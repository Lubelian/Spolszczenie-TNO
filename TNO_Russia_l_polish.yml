Gdy w latach pięćdziesiątych Syberię ogarnęła anarchia, ostatnie resztki Floty Pacyfiku zostały zniszczone lub sprowadzone do piractwa wokół Kamczatki. Teraz, gdy wreszcie przywrócono porządek, mamy środki na odbudowę naszej marynarki wojennej.\n\nŚwiat postrzega Rosję tak, jakby patrzyła na zatopiony pancernik: niegdyś potężny statek, pozostawiony na dnie oceanu, by gnił i rozkładał się na dnie oceanu. Choć marynarka wojenna może nie być najbardziej praktyczną inwestycją, biorąc pod uwagę naszą sytuację, wystawienie okrętów na morze pomoże nam chronić nasz handel, a co więcej, pokaże światu, że podnieśliśmy się z głębin, w które zostaliśmy zepchnięci, udowadniając, że potrafimy sami o siebie zadbać, zarówno na lądzie, w powietrzu, jak i na Pacyfiku."

Projekt ten został przerwany z powodu wybuchu II wojny światowej i pozostały po nim tylko szczątki. Teraz, gdy nasz prawowity rząd rosyjski przywrócił porządek w regionie, możemy wznowić program i budować na fundamentach, które nam pozostawiono.\n\nTo będzie długie i trudne zadanie, ale jeśli odniesiemy sukces, ogromne bogactwa i strategiczna infrastruktura, które uzyskamy dzięki projektowi, okażą się niezbędne w naszych wysiłkach na rzecz zjednoczenia Rosji."

Znaleźliśmy jednak obszary, w których §Ddiamenty§! nadające się do użytku przemysłowego można wydobywać w wystarczająco dużych ilościach, aby były one w pewnym stopniu opłacalne.

Ustanawiając stałą obecność na tym obszarze, rozpoczniemy długi proces przekształcania tych pól w odpowiednie kopalnie odkrywkowe, umożliwiające wydobycie na dużą skalę. Aby to ułatwić, duże fundusze państwowe zostaną zainwestowane w ulepszenie starych sowieckich linii kolejowych w regionie, aby pomóc w transporcie towarów do iz tych nowych ośrodków przemysłowych.\nW związku z tym możemy uznać, że wyprawa na Sachę była kosztownym sukcesem, ale jednak sukcesem, który zaprocentuje w dłuższej perspektywie."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_into_the_atomic_age_desc: "Rosja od dawna była uważana przez mocarstwa bliskie i dalekie za zaściankę, rozległy step pełen chłopskich rolników, a dziesięciolecia rewolucji, upadku i wojny domowej niewiele zrobiły, aby zakwestionować to postrzeganie. Ale to się wkrótce zmieni.\n\nDzięki zasobom ludzkim i innym, które zdobyliśmy podczas naszych kampanii ponownego zjednoczenia, mamy możliwość rozpoczęcia programu nuklearnego.\n\nSiła atomu jest wielkim wyrównywaczem w grze geopolitycznej, a my musimy teraz działać, aby ją wykorzystać dla siebie."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_establish_closed_facilities_desc: "Tak jak my jesteśmy zdesperowani, aby odkryć tajemnice atomu, tak nasi wrogowie są równie zdesperowani, aby nam w tym przeszkodzić. Chociaż istnieje wiele sposobów na zwiększenie bezpieczeństwa, bardzo niewiele z nich jest absolutnych, a absolutne bezpieczeństwo jest konieczne, gdy stawka jest tak wysoka.\n\nDlatego cały nasz program jądrowy - laboratoria, zakłady wzbogacania uranu, reaktory i linie produkcyjne - zamkniemy w zamkniętych miastach. Do tych miast nie będzie mógł wjechać ani wyjechać nikt bez bezpośredniego zezwolenia najwyższych szczebli władzy.\n\nChoć jest to kłopotliwe i kosztowne, nie ma to znaczenia. Musimy zapewnić bezpieczeństwo i ochronę programu, i to zrobimy."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_a_foundation_for_research_desc: "Ponad dwadzieścia lat wojny domowej, oprócz wielu innych rzeczy, niemal całkowicie zniszczyło infrastrukturę edukacyjną kraju i doprowadziło do emigracji lub śmierci większości kompetentnych naukowców i fizyków.\n\nJeśli mamy mieć jakąkolwiek nadzieję na kontynuację i ukończenie naszego programu jądrowego, musimy zająć się tą kwestią. Nie możemy czekać, aż wykwalifikowani naukowcy ujawnią się lub powrócą z daleka, ani aż odzyskamy zaawansowane instytuty. Musimy działać.\n\nBędziemy bezpośrednio finansować uniwersytety i ośrodki badawcze, które posiadamy, i uważnie je monitorować pod kątem lojalności i uzdolnień studentów, których można bezpośrednio zrekrutować do naszego programu rozwojowego."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_address_the_uranium_problem_desc: "Rosja to naprawdę ogromna kraina, posiadająca wiele różnorodnych zasobów w ogromnej obfitości. Niestety, o ile nam wiadomo, uran nie należy do nich. Bez stałych i niezawodnych dostaw uranu nie będziemy mieli programu, a tym samym bomby.\n\nDlatego musimy dołożyć wszelkich starań, aby jak najszybciej znaleźć takie źródło zaopatrzenia. Bez względu na koszty, musimy znaleźć nowe źródła materiałów rozszczepialnych."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_expand_the_dalur_mines_desc: "Nasze wysiłki zmierzające do znalezienia dodatkowych źródeł uranu w kraju przyniosły owoce. Na wschód od Uralu, w pobliżu miasta Kurgan, geodeci twierdzą, że znaleźli ogromne złoże uranu gotowe do eksploatacji.\n\nAby zabezpieczyć złoże, trzeba będzie zbudować od podstaw całą kopalnię i otaczającą ją infrastrukturę. Wymagany wysiłek będzie ogromny, a koszty jeszcze większe, ale to nieistotne - musimy mieć ten uran!"

 RUS_RWS_nukes_source_foreign_materials_desc: "Jeśli w kraju nie znajdziemy wystarczającej ilości uranu, aby wesprzeć nasz program, będziemy musieli szukać dalej. Agenci, legalni i nie tylko, zostaną rozesłani po całym świecie, aby badać i analizować zarówno znane, jak i podobno znane złoża uranu.\n\nNiezależnie od tego, czy będziemy musieli kupić materiał, wymienić go na inny, czy ukraść, zdobędziemy go. Program musi być kontynuowany, a bomba nie dba o to, skąd pochodzi materiał, który się w niej znajduje."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_chasing_the_sun_desc: "Chociaż minie dużo czasu, zanim będziemy mieli sprawną broń jądrową, z powodzeniem zbudowaliśmy infrastrukturę niezbędną do zapewnienia, że ​​w końcu to osiągniemy.\n\nNasze laboratoria i obiekty badawcze są zbudowane i zabezpieczone. Nasze instytucje edukacyjne kształcą naukowców z odpowiednimi umiejętnościami. Nasze agencje zabezpieczyły zarówno krajowe, jak i zagraniczne źródła materiałów rozszczepialnych. Pozostaje tylko czas.\n\nKiedy nadejdzie ten dzień i przeprowadzimy pierwszą próbę jądrową, będziemy mogli być dumni zarówno z naszych osiągnięć, jak i ze świadomości, że [GetRussiaNameNuke] będzie wreszcie wolna od ingerencji z zewnątrz."

Ale to się wkrótce zmieni.\n\nDzięki zasobom ludzkim i innym, które zdobyliśmy podczas naszych kampanii ponownego zjednoczenia, mamy możliwość rozpoczęcia programu nuklearnego.\n\nSiła atomu jest wielkim wyrównywaczem w grze geopolitycznej, a my musimy teraz działać, aby ją wykorzystać dla siebie."

 RUS_SIB_nukes_establish_closed_facilities_desc: "Tak jak my jesteśmy zdesperowani, aby odkryć tajemnice atomu, tak nasi wrogowie są równie zdesperowani, aby nam w tym przeszkodzić. Chociaż istnieje wiele sposobów na zwiększenie bezpieczeństwa, bardzo niewiele z nich jest absolutnych, a absolutne bezpieczeństwo jest konieczne, gdy stawka jest tak wysoka.\n\nDlatego cały nasz program jądrowy - laboratoria, zakłady wzbogacania uranu, reaktory i linie produkcyjne - zamkniemy w zamkniętych miastach. Do tych miast nie będzie mógł wjechać ani wyjechać nikt bez bezpośredniego zezwolenia najwyższych szczebli władzy.\n\nChoć jest to kłopotliwe i kosztowne, nie ma to znaczenia.

Nie możemy czekać, aż wykwalifikowani naukowcy ujawnią się lub powrócą z daleka, ani aż odzyskamy zaawansowane instytuty. Musimy działać.\n\nBędziemy bezpośrednio finansować uniwersytety i ośrodki badawcze, które posiadamy, i uważnie je monitorować pod kątem lojalności i uzdolnień studentów, których można bezpośrednio zrekrutować do naszego programu rozwojowego."

Bez stałych i niezawodnych dostaw uranu nie będziemy mieli programu, a tym samym bomby.\n\nDlatego musimy dołożyć wszelkich starań, aby jak najszybciej znaleźć takie źródło zaopatrzenia.

Nasze instytucje edukacyjne kształcą naukowców z odpowiednimi umiejętnościami. Nasze agencje zabezpieczyły zarówno krajowe, jak i zagraniczne źródła materiałów rozszczepialnych.

 POLITICS_NO_AUTHORITY_DESC: "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."

The port of Magadan is the only free port that supplies us with a vital trade and commerce line. With this, our economy is practically waiting to boom. We just have to start."

 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_decision_desc: "Wojna, złe zarządzanie i choroba §Rbolszewizmu§! sprawiły, że nasza ukochana Rosja znalazła się w tragicznej sytuacji. Carowie i caryce nie byli zainteresowani dobrobytem jej narodu, a złośliwi §RŻydzi§! zarządzający §RBezbożnym Związkiem§! postrzegali naszą Ojczyznę jedynie jako narzędzie swoich nikczemnych planów. Dlatego kluczową polityką RPF jest zachęcanie nie tylko do §Msprowadzenia większej liczby Rosjan do domu, aby pomogli odbudować naszą Ojczyznę§!, ale także do tego, aby każda Rosjanka robiła wszystko, co w jej mocy, aby §nsprowadzić więcej Rosjan na ten świat§!. Dzięki ostatnim zwycięstwom naszego ruchu jesteśmy jednak w stanie naprawić te historyczne błędy i uzdrowić sytuację demograficzną Rosji."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_decision_desc: "Lata nie były łaskawe dla Rosji. Po brutalności carów nastąpił terror §Rczerwonego zagrożenia§!, tej samej niszczycielskiej siły, która zrujnowała naszą ukochaną ojczyznę i pozwoliła na zajęcie największych miast przez Niemcy. Jednak nie wszystko stracone, a wraz z naszą częścią Syberii zjednoczoną pod naszymi rządami musimy zrobić wszystko, co w naszej mocy, aby rozwiązać ten kryzys demograficzny i postawić Rosję na nogi. Mając pod swoją kontrolą port w Magadanie, możemy nadal §Mzachęcać rosyjskich emigrantów do powrotu do kraju przez ten port w Magadanie§!, a dzięki lepszym plonom rolnym, które uzyskaliśmy dzięki odzyskaniu ziem uprawnych w Amurze od naszego starego "przyjaciela" Rodzajewskiego, możemy pozwolić sobie na podtrzymanie polityki państwa §nzachęcającej rosyjskie rodziny do posiadania większej liczby dzieci§!."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_decision_desc: "Od czasu upadku Romanowów Rosja doświadczała jedynie trudności i rozpaczy bez §gcara§!, który by nimi kierował. Z powodu porażki walecznej §WBiałej Armii§! z rąk §Rbolszewików§! Rosja doświadczyła ludobójstwa, zarówno wewnętrznego, jak i zewnętrznego, widząc nas obrabowanych z ziemi i ludzi, których potrzebujemy do utrzymania naszego państwa. Teraz jednak, gdy w naszym zakątku Syberii przywrócono rządy naszego błogosławionego §gcara§!, możemy podjąć aktywne działania w celu naprawienia tej demograficznej katastrofy i przywrócenia Matce Rosji jej dawnej świetności. Mając pod swoją kontrolą port w Magadanie, możemy nadal §Mzachęcać rosyjskich emigrantów do powrotu do domu, aby pomogli odbudować naszą Ojczyznę§!,  a dzięki zwiększonym plonom rolnym, uzyskanym dzięki odzyskaniu ziem uprawnych w Amurze, możemy zapewnić produkcję żywności w ilości uzasadniającej wprowadzenie aktywnej polityki państwa, §nzachęcającej rosyjskie rodziny do posiadania większej liczby dzieci§!."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_decision_desc: "Despite the temporary setbacks suffered since the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has managed to restore Soviet order and control in the revolting areas of eastern Siberia. While most of the technical difficulties we face can be solved by the NKVD, the same cannot be said about the demographic situation of Siberia. Due to inadequate planning by the previous administration, we currently face a labor shortage that, if allowed to persist, will degrade our chances of achieving our long-term economic and military objectives. With the foresight of the Soviet state, we've §nencouraged Soviet women to have more children§! since 1944. Though scaled back since the relocation of our government to Irkutsk and the reduction in available resources that entailed, the reclamation of the Soviet Far East is allowing us to expand the programs beyond the scope implemented two decades ago. Furthermore, with the legitimate Soviet government once more in control of the last functioning port in the Union we can §Mbegin to bring home temporarily resettled Soviet citizens§! from abroad by having our Agitprop department encourage returnees, while our economists work on calculating the ideal level of compensation involved in this process."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_decision_desc: "Russia's history has been one tragedy followed by another tragedy. For centuries, the people lived under the yoke of the Tsar who saw them as nothing more than beasts of burden for their own exploitative regime. §RLenin§! tried to offer the people a respite from this historical trend, only to be hindered by the §WWhite Army§! and for his legacy to be stalled by the factionalism that followed in the civil war. Many thought that the hope was going to be snuffed out for good when the §RGreat Patriotic War§! ended in a victory for the §gfascists§!, but we've proven them wrong. The tyrants on both the left and the right have been driven out of our corner of Siberia, and now we have a chance to rebuild our Union. However, years of war and the rampant neglect of the plight of the people has resulted in a demographic catastrophe that we need to take steps to remedy if we're ever going to succeed with our §Rrevolution§!. With the only functional ports in Russia firmly under our control we can §Mbegin to bring home Soviet emigres§!, and thanks to our improved farm yields from reclaiming the arable lands in Amur we should have the relative food surplus needed to establish state policies to §nencourage Soviet women to have more children§!, though we may need to compromise on our ideals to do so."
 
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_0: "Nasz §nrodzący się program repopulacji§! został zainicjowany jako jedna z pierwszych polityk RPF, kiedy powstała w Amurze. Ponieważ nasz region jest obdarzony najlepszymi ziemiami uprawnymi na rosyjskim Dalekim Wschodzie, jesteśmy w wyjątkowej sytuacji, by móc podtrzymać nasz ambitny wysiłek postawienia Ojczyzny na nogi. Obecnie program składa się z §Jsilnej zachęty politycznej§! i §Jpaństwowych racji żywnościowych§! dla rodzin wychowujących kilkoro dzieci i zachowujących dobre obyczaje, co ma zwiększyć liczbę urodzeń o §n5%§!. Mając do dyspozycji wszystkie zasoby Dalekiego Wschodu, nasze Ministerstwo Żywności i Rolnictwa przewiduje, że jesteśmy w stanie rozszerzyć ten program. Zapewniając większe przywileje socjalne rodzinom, które wychowują jeszcze większą liczbę dzieci i aktywniej wykorzystują państwowy aparat medialny do motywowania naszych obywateli w tym przedsięwzięciu, powinniśmy odnotować stały wzrost urodzeń na całym naszym terytorium."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_1: "Nasz §nprogram repopulacji§! został zainicjowany jako jedna z pierwszych polityk RPF, kiedy osiedliliśmy się w Amur i od tego czasu nasze wysiłki na rzecz zwiększenia liczby urodzeń wzrosły. Obecnie program polega na §Jsilnych zachętach finansowych§! i §Juznaniu państwa§! dla rodzin, które wychowują więcej dzieci i zachowują dobre obyczaje, co wraz z §Jpropagandą§! ma zwiększyć liczbę urodzeń o §n20%§!. Nasi analitycy uważają, że możemy jeszcze bardziej zwiększyć tę liczbę dzięki zwiększonemu wsparciu dla wdów i wdowców."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_1_tt: "Poprzez dawanie zwiększonych zachęt finansowych rosyjskim małżeństwom za każde dodatkowe dziecko, które mają po czwartym, powinniśmy zaobserwować wzrost liczby urodzeń na naszym terytorium, a także wzrost liczby zdrowych małżeństw i stabilnych gospodarstw domowych. Ponadto docenimy matki, które wykazały wzorowe instynkty macierzyńskie, spełniając swój patriotyczny obowiązek sprowadzenia na świat piątego rosyjskiego dziecka z oficjalną nagrodą państwową: §fKrzyżem Honorowym Matki Rosji§!."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_2: "Nasz §nprogram rozszerzonej repopulacji§! został zainicjowany jako jedna z pierwszych polityk RPF, kiedy rozpoczęliśmy działalność w Amurze, i od tego czasu nasze wysiłki na rzecz zwiększenia populacji rosną w siłę. Obecnie program ten obejmuje §Jsilne zachęty finansowe§! i §Juznanie państwa§! dla rodzin, które wychowują kolejne dzieci i zachowują dobre obyczaje, a także §Jzwiększone wsparcie państwa dla wdów§!. W połączeniu z jeszcze §Jintensywniejszą kampanią propagandową§! wysiłki te mają doprowadzić do zwiększenia liczby urodzeń o §n35%§!. Nasi analitycy uważają, że wyczerpaliśmy możliwości dalszego zwiększania tej liczby."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_repop_2_tt: "Istnieje wiele niefortunnych przeszkód w zwiększaniu naszego przyrostu naturalnego, takich jak liczba rodzin zniszczonych zniszczeniami wojennymi i utrzymująca się działalność wywrotowa §Rbolszewików§!, którzy chcą, aby kobiety odeszły od swoich kobiecych obowiązków. Dzięki pomocy państwa w znalezieniu odpowiednich mężów dla wdów, które zgłoszą się do programu państwowego, oraz dalszemu wsparciu finansowemu ze strony państwa, powinniśmy zaobserwować wzrost liczby stabilnych, funkcjonalnych rodzin na naszym terenie. Ponadto wprowadzona zostanie dodatkowa klasa do §fKrzyża Honorowego Matki Rosji§! dla patriotycznych Rosjanek, które urodziły ósme dziecko i dofinansowują pożyczki na gospodarstwo domowe dla rodziców wychowujących dużą liczbę dzieci."
 
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_0: "§MObecnie brakuje nam zorganizowanego, wszechrosyjskiego programu remigracyjnego§!. Ze względu na nieustanne szkalowanie naszego szlachetnego ruchu przez zaciekłych wrogów Rosji, zarówno z jej granic, jak i poza jej granicami, bardzo trudno będzie zorganizować poważny wysiłek, aby sprowadzić więcej rosyjskich emigrantów z powrotem do naszej Ojczyzny. Nasze Ministerstwo Oświecenia Publicznego uważa, że ​​aby trwale zaradzić temu problemowi, musimy zaoferować ludziom bardzo atrakcyjną ofertę, aby to przezwyciężyć. Jednak biorąc pod uwagę liczby dostarczone przez nasze Ministerstwo Pracy, niedawny wzrost liczby wolnych domów spowodowany naszymi §dprogramami relokacji pracowników§! może pozwolić na przystępne podejście do tej sprawy, pozwoliłoby nam to równieżna zrusyfikowanie buntowniczych prowincji syberyjskich. Zaoferujemy ziemie i dobrą prace rosyjskim patriotom w Jakucku."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_1: "Obecnie prowadzimy §Maktywny program remigracyjny§!. Przyciągamy rosyjskich emigrantów tanimi gruntami i mieszkaniami w Jakucku i okolicach, które zostały skonfiskowane różnym jakuckim buntownikom i zdrajcom Ojczyzny. Podjęto starania, aby zapewnić, że osoby osiedlające się w Rosji otrzymają specjalną opiekę i traktowanie, aby lepiej umożliwić im reintegrację z naszym Państwem Wszechrosyjskim po spędzeniu życia za granicą. §WAleksander Bołotow§! zapewnia nas, że jego ludzie będą uważnie obserwować te społeczności i że wszelka korespondencja z ich przybraną ojczyzną pozostaje pozytywna. Mamy nadzieję, że z czasem poprawi to nasz wizerunek wśród rosyjskiej społeczności emigracyjnej."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "Przy takiej liczbie wolnych miejsc, jakie powstały po stłumieniu oporu Jakutów wobec naszego państwa, powinniśmy rozdysponować te domy patriotycznym Rosjanom mieszkającym za granicą. Każda osoba pochodzenia rosyjskiego może ubiegać się o mocno dotowaną działkę w Jakucji, pod warunkiem, że przejdzie nasz obowiązkowy proces kontroli pod kątem działalności wywrotowej. Aby poprawić nasz wizerunek za granicą, ci, którym uda się przesiedlić do Jakucji, zostaną potraktowani w specjalny sposób. Na znak naszego uznania dla ich chęci pomocy w odbudowie Rosji, przesiedlony Jakut otrzyma rekompensatę w postaci skrócenia wyroków brygady robotniczej za zdradę stanu do zaledwie siedmiu lat."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_2: "Obecnie prowadzimy §Mrozszerzony program remigracyjny§!. Dajemy patriotycznym Rosjanom bardzo subsydiowane umowy dotyczące ziemi, ale aktywnie zachęcamy do sprowadzania do domu tych, którzy zdobyli doświadczenie pracy w przemyśle za granicą, do dobrze płatnych miejsc pracy. §WAleksander Bołotow§! i jego ludzie nadal aktywnie starają się mieć oko na tę powracającą społeczność, która obciąża nasze służby bezpieczeństwa. Chociaż mamy nadzieję rozszerzyć ten program w przyszłości, wierzymy, że osiągnęliśmy maksymalny potencjał naszego programu do momentu zjednoczenia narodowego."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "Ponieważ nasze wysiłki na rzecz ponownego zasiedlenia Jakucka odniosły pewien sukces, możemy teraz rozszerzyć nasze wysiłki, aby sprowadzić do domu więcej rosyjskich emigrantów. Szerząc nasze przesłanie daleko i szeroko, będziemy zachęcać Rosjan mieszkających w Europie, obu Amerykach i poza nią do powrotu do domu, oferując im mocno dotowane grunty i dobrze płatną pracę w sektorze górniczym. Zachęcanie emigrantów do powrotu to wciąż trudna walka, ale mamy nadzieję, że gdy tylko wystawimy przed nimi odpowiednią marchewkę, zobaczą, że mają rację i wrócą, by pomóc w odbudowie naszej ojczyzny."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_3: "Obecnie prowadzimy §Mrozszerzony program remigracyjny§!. Dajemy patriotycznym Rosjanom bardzo subsydiowane umowy dotyczące ziemi, ale aktywnie zachęcamy do sprowadzania do domu tych, którzy zdobyli doświadczenie pracy w przemyśle za granicą, do dobrze płatnych miejsc pracy. Oprócz tego prowadzimy również §Mwszechrosyjski program repatriacji§!, którego celem jest przesiedlenie wielu tysięcy Rosjan wciąż mieszkających w Mandżurii ze swoją ojczyzną, co pozwoli im stopniowo wycofywać część naszej siły roboczej. Pomimo wielu trudności, jakie napotykaliśmy w naszych staraniach o sprowadzenie do domu zaginionych synów i córek Rosji, możemy wreszcie twierdzić, że nasz program odniósł taki sukces, jak tylko możemy mieć nadzieję, i że wyczerpaliśmy nasze możliwości dalszego rozszerzenia."
 RUS_FE_AMR_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "Na południe od nas leżą rozległe tereny rosyjskie, które od czasu ostatecznego rozpadu §RNieświętego Związku§! znalazły się pod jurysdykcją Mandżurów. Nasz §WWożd Konstantin Rodzajewski§! ma nadzieję, że cały ten region zostanie w końcu zjednoczony z Rosją, jednak w najbliższym czasie będziemy musieli zadowolić się wykorzystaniem naszych wpływów u lokalnych władz w celu zorganizowania programu repatriacji tysięcy Rosjan, którzy nadal żyją pod władzą Mandżurów. Będzie to jednak kosztowne przedsięwzięcie.  Z politycznego punktu widzenia wymagałoby to negocjacji i poświęcenia przez nas części naszych wpływów na odzyskanie regionu w przyszłości. Z ekonomicznego punktu widzenia, oczywistym kosztem jest przesiedlenie dziesiątek tysięcy ludzi w bardzo krótkim czasie i znalezienie dla nich pracy, co można osiągnąć jedynie poprzez redystrybucję majątku byłych członków naszej więziennej siły roboczej i powolną pracę nad zapewnieniem im pracy zarobkowej w sektorach, w których obecnie polegamy na jednostkach pracy poprawczej."

 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_1: "We're currently maintaining an §Mactive remigration program§!.

We're currently looking into expanding our reach, both through our port capacity as well as by allowing Radio Magadan to make special broadcasts to abroad in numerous languages."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "Dzięki doświadczeniu, które zdobyliśmy dzięki naszej długotrwałej kontroli nad portem Magadan, możemy stosunkowo łatwo rozszerzyć nasz program remigracyjny. Dzięki temu moglibyśmy aktywniej sprowadzać do domu Rosjan mieszkających za granicą, dzięki temu, że nasze MSZ będzie rozpowszechniało wśród rosyjskich emigrantów informacje o korzyściach płynących z powrotu do ojczyzny, do prawdziwego państwa rosyjskiego. Ponadto będą oferowane zachęty finansowe, aby zachęcić ich do powrotu do nas. Choć może to być kosztowne, fakt, że większość z nich ma się lepiej niż my tutaj, na Syberii, powinien być zastrzykiem pieniędzy dla naszej gospodarki."
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpansive remigration program§! as well as utilizing §Mshortwave radio transmissions§! to reach more Russians living abroad. Though there's room for further expansions, the party isn't fully unified on the matter as the party's old guard prefers to focus on Russian emigres, an endeavor that has currently reached its plateau. On the other hand, only the reformists advocate for an effort to increase the scope of our efforts, and would need to have a majority control of the party to push their agenda through"
 RUS_FE_MAG_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "We'll increase the funding for our program and actively seek out Russians with experience in bureaucratic lines of work by giving them extra incentives to return home to their Motherland.

Put together, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n10%§!. Our department of public health estimates that we can boost this number even further by increasing the program's scope and benefits."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_repop_1_tt: "We'll initiate our efforts to increase our population by giving financial incentives to couples to marry and have additional children. Furthermore, we'll introduce an Imperial recognition of their efforts to their §gTsar§! and Motherland by raising a large and healthy family: the §JMedal of Parental Glory§!."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_repop_2: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has been expanded and is yielding good results.

 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_repop_2_tt: "We'll escalate our efforts to increase the Realm's population by giving additional financial incentives for couples to marry and have additional children, offset by taxing those who refuse to marry and form families. Furthermore, we'll introduce a second class to the §JMedal of Parental Glory§! to be awarded to families that showed exceptional devotion to their §gTsar§! and Motherland by bringing at least eight healthy children into this world."

 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_0: "§MWe currently lack an organized remigration program§!. Thanks to possessing the only good port in Russia and our good ties with the more conservative elements of the Russian emigre community we should be able to put together a program encouraging Russians living abroad to return home. As an added benefit, they'll bring their money and skills with them."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_1: "We're currently maintaining an §Mactive remigration program§!. Though nascent, the program is already bearing fruit with a steady stream of emigres returning every month thanks to our coordinated efforts. By expanding our efforts further, we should be able to bring home some skilled administrators sympathetic to the §WWhite movement§! and our §gTsar§!."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "By initiating a remigration program, we can more actively bring home Russians living abroad by having the Imperial office for information distribute information to Russians emigres. Furthermore, financial incentives will be given to encourage them to return to their §gTsar§!. Costly though it may be, the fact that most of them are better off than we are here in Siberia should see an injection of money into our economy."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpansive remigration program§!. Through it, we've managed to improve our population situation, as well as brought wealth and knowledge back into our Imperial realm. The program has room to grow, but we'll not be able to expand it until we've fully settled the political disputes of our Empire. The §WWhite Army§! wishes for us to look to the south, to the §fCo-Prosperity Sphere§!. Our §gTsar§!, on the other hand, feels like we should reach out to §QOFN§! communities instead. Until this matter is resolved, any further expansions to the program are halted."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "We'll increase the funding for our program and actively seek out Russians with experience in bureaucratic lines of work by giving them extra incentives to return home to their Motherland and provide their expertise to the §gTsar's§! efforts to rebuild our Realm."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_3_CPS: "§MWe're currently maintaining an expanded remigration program with eased travel from the §fCPS§! bloc to our realm§!. With a steady stream of emigrants returning to the Imperial realm of Russia, we've achieved the maximum potential for what our program can realize by letting a substantial number of Russia's lost sons and daughters find their way back home again."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_3_CPS_tt: "With the realm firmly under the control of the §WWhite Army§! and a more pragmatic ruler, we'll open our doors to the §fCPS§!, allowing for easier travel between us. This will bolster our population further as we'll be able to reach out to the emigre community in the south far more efficiently, as well as attracting experienced Chinese and Japanese engineers and industry workers to our Imperial realm"

With a steady stream of emigrants returning to the Imperial realm of Russia, we've achieved the maximum potential for what our program can realize by letting a substantial number of Russia's lost sons and daughters find their way back home again."
 RUS_FE_CHT_manpower_immigration_3_OFN_tt: "With the people's beloved §gTsar§! in firm control over the Imperial realm, we can finally open up to the §QOFN§!, allowing for easier travel from America and OFN-leaning nations to us, easing the process for emigres to return along with people from Europe and the Americas that seek a new life, adventure or a return to conservative monarchism in the Russian far east. Opening up further to OFN and improving our relationship with the bloc will also allow us to bring in more people educated at their universities."

 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_repop_0: "Currently, §nwe operate a downscaled version of the repopulation efforts§! introduced in 1944 where §Jstate awards§! and §Jsocial benefits§! are given to patriotic Soviet women who do their part in valiantly fighting the battle for improved demographics, increasing our birth rates by §n5%§!. With the increased resources available to us in terms of finances and access to arable lands."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_repop_1: "Our §nrepopulation program§! been expanded and is currently consisting of §Jpolitical and financial incentives§! as well as §Jstate recognition§! for Soviet mothers that raise several healthy children. Put together, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n15%§!. Our economists believe, however, that we'll have a hard time expanding the program further without reducing women's access to the workplace."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_repop_1_tt: "Through active propaganda efforts to encourage Soviet women to have more children as well as a program of increased state benefits, we should see an uptick in the number of children born to each Soviet woman. Furthermore, we'll reintroduce additional financial aid to patriotic women who have earned the title of §JMother Heroine§! for having ten or more children."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_repop_2: "Our §nexpanded repopulation program§! has reached its peak and is yielding positive results, but has plateaued for now. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong political incentives§! and §Jofficial state honors§! for Soviet women that bear and raise a large number of healthy children. Put together with our compromise on women's role in the labor force, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n25%§!."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_repop_2_tt: "We'll escalate our efforts to increase our population by incentivizing Soviet women to avoid actively entering the workforce before they've had at least three children. Laws will be changed to give tax breaks for married couples, paid for by levying increased taxes on singles with exemptions for veterans, widows and widowers. Furthermore, additional benefits for holders of the §JMother Heroine§! title will further raise the effectiveness of the program. Though it'll strain our production output and finances, it's a price our economists believe will pay off in the long term through the increased number of active participants in the labor force"

 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_0: "§MWe currently do not operate any active remigration programs§!. By creating social and economic incentives to return and then have our Agitprop spread information targeting Soviet emigre communities, we'll be able to encourage Soviet citizens to return home to the new home of our revolution."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_1: "We're currently maintaining a §Mlimited remigration program§! focused on tightly controlled resettlements with the NKVD supervising the communications of the returning expats. Despite the need for control, the program is already bearing fruit with a steady stream of former Soviet citizens returning home to us every month thanks to our coordinated efforts to provide information, means of travel and economic incentives to them. Our efforts, however, are hampered by an image problem, as well as a lack of suitable areas to resettle people without the risk of creating a negative international perception of our state. With increased funding, we should be able to remedy this situation."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "With the port of Magadan in our hands, we can put together coordinated state efforts to encourage former Soviet citizens to return home and assist in the rebuilding of our country, the first step of many in ensuring the return of our momentarily dispersed citizenry. As we cannot fully trust those, however, we'll limit the resettlement to parts of Magadan and Irkutsk that we know to be suitable for foreign expectations."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_15: "We're currently maintaining a §Mtightly controlled remigration program§! focused on tightly controlled resettlements with the NKVD supervising the communications of the returning expats. Despite the need for control, the program is already bearing fruit with a steady stream of former Soviet citizens returning home to us every month thanks to our coordinated efforts to provide information, means of travel and economic incentives to them. With Yakutsk turned into a revitalized city of socialist labor, we'll soon be ready to step up the remigration program. Naturally, all applicants for resettlement in Yakutsk have been discretely registered and screened"
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_15_tt: "Even during the times of Bukharin, it was common practice to make sure that those who visited the Soviet Union were treated to the best the nation had to offer. After all, seeing the lingering destruction of the White Army's rampage across the USSR or seeing a region that'd yet to fully realize the positive effects of our government's reforms was always something that risked harming the nation's image. Yakutsk is ideal location for a revitalization project aimed at giving returning Soviet citizens the best possible image of our recovering Soviet Union. Not only are there plenty of economic opportunities in the region to justify making permanent improvements to it, but it's also easy to survey and monitor what goes in and out. While the construction work is ongoing, we'll put the word out within the Soviet emigre communities that there's bread, land and well-paying labor waiting for them in their former homeland."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mmonitored remigration program§! centered around §Mcontrolled resettlements to Yakutsk§! to ensure an equilibrium between our need for new, loyal citizens and the Union's need for security. While we've currently plateaued our reach in the Soviet emigre community, we're currently looking into other venues as our experiences with maintaining the stability of Yakutsk proves that we can take on a bigger challenge, though at the risk of overstretching our security services."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "With Yakutsk prepared and with the NKVD in place to make sure that everything goes smoothly, we're ready to begin the resettlement of trustworthy applicants to the city - an example of socialist efficiency that's sure to impress the world."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_3: "We're currently maintaining a §Mtightly controlled and vetted immigration program§!. Driven by §Mintensive propaganda and aimed at socialist communities in the CPS and OFN§!. The message to the world that Yakutsk is a socialist utopia where people can experience true socialism has reached far and wide with our security services working hard that no troublemakers enter our union, nor that a bad word of it leaves the region of the former republic of Yakutia. This, however, represents the limit of our program's realistic growth as any further expansions may endanger the security of our union."
 RUS_FE_IRK_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "Through an extended enlightenment campaign by Agitprop, we'll let everyone within the reach of our radio broadcasts know that Yakutsk is the socialist utopia of the east. With the increased effectiveness of our NKVD operatives in ensuring the stability of the returning population's experiences, we can even expand the program to applicants from the CPS and OFN territories as well - provided that they pass our rigorous screening process, of course"

 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_repop_0: "Currently, §Mwe do not operate an active repopulation program§! as we never reinstated the policies practiced by the USSR after driving out the tyrant Yagoda from Irkutsk. If we wish to, we can use a mix of economic incentives and political encouragement to encourage Soviet women to have more children without sacrificing our ideals for socialist equality."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_repop_1: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has been reintroduced in a limited scale. Currently, the program consists of §Jpolitical and financial incentives§! as well as §Jstate recognition§! of parents that raise several healthy children. Put together, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n7.5%§!. Our economists believe that if we are to see more results from this, we'll need to restrict women's ability to be active in the workforce"
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_repop_1_tt: "We'll initiate our efforts to increase our population by having Agitprop encourage Soviet women to have more children. Furthermore, we'll reintroduce the §JOrder of Maternal Glory§! to Soviet women who bear and raise at least seven children and give the recipients of this award a series of additional economic benefits."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_repop_2: "Our §nrepopulation program§! has been expanded and is yielding positive results, but has plateaued for now. Currently, the program consists of §Jstrong political incentives§! and official §Jstate honors§! for Soviet women that bear and raise a large number of healthy children. Put together with our limited compromise on women's role in the labor force, our efforts are expected to increase births by §n15%§!."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_repop_2_tt: "We'll escalate our efforts to increase our population by incentivizing Soviet women to avoid actively entering the workforce before they've had children. Furthermore, additional benefits for recipients of the §JOrder of Maternal Glory§! to make the economic situation for parents easier. By doing this at a small scale, we should be able to achieve our goals without sacrificing the Soviet women's liberation from the old class structures in the process"

We're currently looking into expanding our reach by effectivizing the Agitprop's efforts to bring information to emigre communities as well as increasing social benefits to help them start their new lives in our Soviet Republic."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_immigration_1_tt: "With the port of Magadan in our hands, we can put together coordinated state efforts to encourage former Soviet citizens to return home and assist in the rebuilding of our country. In addition, we'll also make a concerted effort to reach people with a background in industry and construction."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_immigration_2: "We're currently maintaining an §Mexpanded remigration program§! utilizing §Mmodern socialist propaganda§! to reach more Soviet citizens living abroad. While our endeavor has currently reached its plateau, our Department of Agitation and Propaganda believes that once we've developed our Soviet Republic further we can open ourselves up as a refuge for socialists facing repression across the world, organizing efforts to bring them into our Soviet society in exchange for their participation in our revolutionary cause."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_immigration_2_tt: "By increasing the effectiveness of Agitprop's efforts to reach out to Sovoet emigre communities abroad as well as giving stronger social incentives to return, we should see a boost in the effectiveness of our program."
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_immigration_3: "We're currently maintaining a §Mglobal program for socialist migration§!, bolstered with §Mthe full force of our department of Agitation and Propaganda§!. With thousands of socialists fleeing persecution from as far away as Africa, the Middle East and South America arriving in the port of Magadan every month, we can truly call ourselves a beacon of light in this world, one that gives hope to the downtrodden living under the exploitative yoke of capitalist and fascist regimes alike"
 RUS_FE_BRY_manpower_immigration_3_tt: "With most of Siberia's resources available to us we are now ready to turn our Soviet remigration program into a socialist immigration program aimed at expanding the travel and settlement incentives previously exclusive to the Soviet emigre community to persecuted socialist communities."

 #Raiding
 raiding.100.t: "Ultimatum"
 raiding.100.d: "Otrzymaliśmy ultimatum od [FROM.GetNameDef], żądają od nas przekazania daniny w postaci łupów, w przeciwnym razie napadną na nas i zabiorą je nam tak czy inaczej.\n\nJesteśmy w impasie, czy zdecydujemy się na konfrontację z [FROM.GetNameDef], ryzykując, że nasi ludzie zginą z rąk naszych wrogów, czy też zamiast tego wycofamy się i ulegniemy ich żądaniom, dając im pożądany łup, pozwalając naszym ludziom żyć, by walczyć kolejnego dnia?"
 raiding.100.a: "Nie wycofamy się tak łatwo!"
 raiding.100.b: "Być może najlepiej będzie, jeśli ustąpimy i zapłacimy im upragnioną daninę."

 raiding.101.t: "Odmawiają trybut"
 raiding.101.d: "Jak można się spodziewać, [FROM.GetNameDef] powiedział nam, że odrzuca naszą ofertę i jest gotowy do walki, musimy przygotować naszych ludzi do walki.\n\nNiestety, rozlew krwi jest czasem nieunikniony i musimy przygotować się na to, co ma nadejść, jeśli nie zamierzają współpracować, nadszedł czas, aby siłą zabrać łup z [FROM.GetNameDef]."
 raiding.101.a: "Odgłosy strzelaniny wciąż rozbrzmiewają w Rosji..."
 raiding.101.a.tt: "...tylko po to, by zostać odwołanym przez nagłą zmianę."

 raiding.102.t: "Zapłacono trybut"
 raiding.102.d: "Cudem [FROM.GetNameDef] ugiął się i zapłacił nam daninę, przekazując upragniony łup ze swojego państwa. Uniknęliśmy rozlewu krwi, a nasi ludzie żyją, by walczyć kolejny dzień, jest mało prawdopodobne, aby [FROM.GetNameDef] znów się nam tak łatwo poddawał."
 raiding.102.a: "Zagrożenia są czasem potrzebne, aby przetrwać w anarchii rosyjskiej."

 raiding.103.t: "Udana kontrofensywa"
 raiding.103.d: "Nasze meldunki wróciły, nasi ludzie spieszą do domu z ciężarówkami pełnymi łupów i krwią na rękach. Gratulują sobie nawzajem udanego kontrataku na niczego nie spodziewającego się wroga, poklepują swoich towarzyszy po plecach i oddają kilka ostatnich strzałów do uciekających niedobitków. Ogłaszamy zwycięstwo w tej potyczce, a nasi ludzie wiwatują i gwiżdżą w wojennej histerii, z niecierpliwością prezentując nam skarby, które wyrwali z rąk naszych przeciwników."
 raiding.103.a: "Zgarnijcie wszystko, co może nam się przydać."
 
 raiding.104.t: "Counter-Raid Canceled"
 raiding.104.d: "We have no choice but to cancel the counter-raid. Our raiding party rabble and rave, unable to communicate and work as a unit. They constantly jam their guns, and feud over scraps of ammunition they steal from each other. To send these clueless regulars out would be ridiculous - suicidal, even. Our time is best spent arming and training these men with the few resources we can gather so our next raid will not end in a total disgrace."
 raiding.104.a: "We were just not prepared..."
 
 raiding.105.t: "The Counter-Raid Fails"
 raiding.105.d: "Our men rush back from the frontier, wounded and bloody. Some dash with bandages wrapped around their battered heads; others lay motionless on the back of moving vehicles groaning and beckoning for help. The raid against our neighbors was an ambush, and they repelled our men with deadly force. Some of our dead are wagoned back with gashed flesh, exploded skulls, or chewed up by machine gun fire. We need more time to recover and recuperate, and perhaps with enough resources we can strike again."
 raiding.105.a: "We'll get the bastards next time!"

 raiding.1.t: "Najazd zakończony sukcesem"
 raiding.1.d: "Nasze raporty wróciły, nasi ludzie wracają do domu z ciężarówkami pełnymi łupów i krwią na rękach. Gratulują sobie nawzajem udanego najazdu na niczego niepodejrzewającego wroga, poklepując swoich towarzyszy po plecach i oddając kilka ostatnich strzałów do uciekających ocalałych. Ogłaszamy zwycięstwo w tej potyczce, a nasi ludzie wiwatują i gwiżdżą w histerii wojny, chętni, by przedstawić nam skarby, które wydobyli z uścisku naszych przeciwników."
 raiding.1.a: "Zabierzcie wszystko, co może się nam przydać."
 
 raiding.2.t: "Najazd odwołany"
 raiding.2.d: "Nie mamy innego wyjścia, jak tylko odwołać najazd. Nasi grabieżcy szaleją, nie potrafią się porozumieć i pracować jako jednostka. Ciągle zacina im się broń i kłócą się o skrawki amunicji, które kradną sobie nawzajem.  Wysłanie tych pozbawionych wiedzy szeregowych żołnierzy byłoby niedorzeczne, a nawet samobójcze. Najlepiej poświęcić nasz czas na uzbrojenie i wyszkolenie tych ludzi za pomocą niewielu zasobów, które możemy zgromadzić, aby nasz kolejny najazd nie zakończył się całkowitą hańbą."
 raiding.2.a: "Po prostu nie byliśmy przygotowani..."
 
 raiding.3.t: "Najazd nie powiódł się"
 raiding.3.d: "Nasi ludzie wracają z frontu, ranni i zakrwawieni. Niektórzy biegają z bandażami owiniętymi wokół poobijanych głów; inni leżeli nieruchomo na jadących pojazdach, jęcząc i wołając o pomoc. Najazd na naszych sąsiadów był zasadzką, a oni odparli naszych ludzi ze śmiertelną siłą. Niektórzy z naszych zmarłych są odciągani z powrotem z pociętymi ciałami, roztrzaskanymi czaszkami lub przeżartymi przez ogień karabinów maszynowych. Potrzebujemy więcej czasu, aby się zregenerować i odzyskać siły, a być może z wystarczającymi zasobami będziemy mogli uderzyć ponownie."
 raiding.3.a: "Następnym razem dorwiemy tych drani!"
 
 raiding.4.t: "Zostaliśmy napadnięci!"
 raiding.4.d: "Nasze raporty wróciły z granic i są to straszne wieści. Bandyci zastawili zasadzkę na nasze garnizony i zmasakrowali naszych ludzi, pozostawiając ich w postaci groteskowych i poskręcanych trupów rozrzuconych po równinach. Co więcej, doniesiono nam, że przeniknęli do przygranicznych miast i wiosek, plądrując i grabiąc co się da z bezbronnej ludności. Nasze oddziały są nieprzygotowane, więc niewiele możemy zrobić, gdy uciekają tam, skąd przyszli, pozostawiając za sobą ścieżkę całkowitego nieszczęścia i szału."
 raiding.4.a: "Drogi Boże!"
 
 raiding.5.t: "The Enemy Falters"
 raiding.5.d: "With our recent preparation of defense procedures across the frontiers, the bandits from across the border scurry back into the shadows. No longer do they froth at the mouth and hunger for our bounties as they fear our potential for violent conflict over these contested territories. Clearly, expert defense and mind games have won the battle before a single drop of blood needed to be shed, as the enemy cowers before the skill and might of [Root.GetName]."
 raiding.5.a: "Hah! Look at the cowards run!"
 
 raiding.6.t: "Wróg został pokonany"
 raiding.6.d: "Pojawiły się ostatnio doniesienia o miażdżącym zwycięstwie nad niedawną grupą bandytów. W brutalnym starciu zostali zdziesiątkowani przez nasze waleczne siły obronne, a teraz ich ciała leżą rozrzucone i okaleczone przez wojnę. Z tymi, którzy przeżyli, uciekając w głąb mglistych granic, nasi żołnierze śpiewają pieśni o zwycięstwie i bohaterstwie w obliczu najeżdżającego zła. Gorączka krwawej porażki z pewnością da im lekcję o atakowaniu ziem [Root.GetName] przez wiele lat!"
 raiding.6.a: "Przejdźmy teraz do sprzątania trupów..."
 
 raiding.7.t: "Relikty przeszłości"
 raiding.7.d: "Nasz ostatni rajd na terytorium wroga zakończył się spektakularnym sukcesem. Po pokonaniu sił wroga na polu bitwy, nasi dzielni żołnierze wkroczyli do kilku przygranicznych miast i zebrali skarby z czasów, gdy Rosja była zjednoczona. Służąc jako bolesne przypomnienie naszych własnych żałosnych podziałów, stwierdziliśmy, że niektóre z tych przedmiotów mogą okazać się przydatne w rozwoju naszego rodzącego się przemysłu. Mamy nadzieję, że pomogą nam one powrócić do pozycji potęgi, w której te towary zostały wytworzone, i podnieść te ziemie do godnego szacunku i pokojowego sposobu życia."
 raiding.7.a: "Ale musimy też myśleć o przyszłości..."
 
 raiding.8.t: "Jedzenie dla głodnych"
 raiding.8.d: "W końcu wszyscy wreszcie mają jedzenie na noc i nie musimy już dłużej pracować nad pustymi brzuchami i złamanymi sercami. Życie na pół racji żywnościowych przez miesiące nauczyło nas wstrzemięźliwości i opanowania, ale wgryzało się w nasze umysły w cichej i lodowatej histerii. Teraz mamy mnóstwo pożywienia dla przyszłych pokoleń, a ludzie [Root.GetName] mogą rozpocząć swoje trudy bez dokuczającego im głodu przez ich szalenie męczące dni."
 raiding.8.a: "Chyba nie będziemy dziś głodni..."
 
 raiding.9.t: "Łupy wojenne"
 raiding.9.d: "Zwycięstwo! Nasze grupy rabusiów ciągną do domu wielkie nagrody przywiązane do dachów pojazdów wojskowych i wrzucane do worków przewożonych konno z terytoriów wroga. Dzięki tym skarbom jesteśmy w stanie napełnić nasze kufry, uzupełnić zapasy w naszych zbrojowniach i zwiększyć produkcję w naszych lokalnych gałęziach przemysłu. Równowaga sił wyraźnie przesunęła się na naszą korzyść, a z każdą kolejną potyczką jesteśmy lepiej uzbrojeni, by stawić czoła wyzwaniom, które wdzierają się przez dzikie rosyjskie granice."
 raiding.9.a: "Pomoże to w przyszłości."
 
 raiding.10.t: "Skarb!"
 raiding.10.d: "Nasi ludzie zmiażdżyli wroga i wykorzenili wszystko, co jest użyteczne, do naszych oddziałów szturmowych. W chaosie i histerii przemocy niektórzy z naszych ludzi przedarli się przez zamki magazynu i natknęli się na wielkie skarby poza naszymi najśmielszymi snami! Zbieranie złota, metali szlachetnych, posągów i innych pozostałości z przeszłości Rosji, zaciąganie tych relikwii do domu przynosi nam ogromne bogactwo, prestiż i nostalgię na wspaniały czas. Być może to, nawet w przemocy i brutalności tych potyczek, jest znakiem nadchodzących wspaniałych czasów dla naszego ludu."
 raiding.10.a: "Relikt przeszłości..."
 
 raiding.11.t: "Maszyny z przeszłości"
 raiding.11.d: "Po rozgromieniu wroga, nasi ludzie wdarli się do jego magazynów i zbrojowni, wyrywając wszystko, co się przydało i niszcząc resztę, której nie dało się przenieść. Grupa naszych żołnierzy natknęła się na magazyn, w którym mieścił się wspaniały sprzęt przemysłowy. Wypadałoby jedynie przypiąć maszyny do tyłu naszych pojazdów i przewieźć je do naszych fabryk, gdzie można je przejąć i zintegrować z naszymi liniami produkcyjnymi. Być może pewnego dnia, z jedną maszyną na raz, uda nam się odbudować Rosję od podstaw i przywrócić jej dawną świetność."
 raiding.11.a: "Dzięki nim może Rosja zostanie kiedyś odbudowana..."
 
 raiding.12.t: "Wspomnienia z przeszłości"
 raiding.12.d: "Nasi ludzie wpadli do opustoszałych wówczas baz wojskowych wroga, otoczeni ciałami poległych. Wdzierając się przez drzwi, krzycząc i zawodząc w wojennej histerii, i otwierając masowy ogień do każdego marudera, nasi ludzie latali po ciasnych korytarzach i zbombardowanych pomieszczeniach. Rozbierali szafy i magazyny w poszukiwaniu zapasów, broni i sprzętu, aż jeden oddział rzucił się do magazynu tylko po to, by znaleźć relikty starej Rosji. Złożyli ręce i zaczęli zbierać wszystkie zdjęcia, taśmy wideo i przedmioty, jakie tylko mogli. Odbierając towar dziś rano, znaleźliśmy ogromne bogactwo w filmach, książkach i obrazach Rosji sprzed anarchii - kuszące przypomnienie naszej przeszłej chwały i obecnego wstydu."
 raiding.12.a: "With these maybe Russia will be united once more..."
 
 raiding.13.t: "Kradzież żywności"
 raiding.13.d: "Dziś rano zastaliśmy nasze zapasy żywności opróżnione i splądrowane przez zbiegłych bandytów i przestępców. W co najmniej trzech miejscach splądrowano magazyny ze zbożem, mięsem, solą i konserwami, pozostawiając po sobie jedynie kilka rozsypanych worków jęczmienia i zniszczone puszki z mięsem. Dzieci kładą się spać głodne w nocy, a rolnicy walczą o utrzymanie naszej populacji. Coś trzeba zrobić, bo już za kilka tygodni nasi ludzie zwrócą się przeciwko sobie, żeby coś zjeść."
 raiding.13.a: "Wygląda na to, że w tym miesiącu racje za pół racji"
 
 raiding.14.t: "Garnizon wyrżnięty"
 raiding.14.d: "Budzimy się dziś na wieść o śmierci i klęsce. Nasze koszary zostały spustoszone przez bandytów, a nasi żołnierze leżą martwi na ziemi w szczególnie makabryczny i przerażający sposób. Z krwią i mózgami rozbryzganymi na ścianach i dymem unoszącym się z kwater żołnierskich, nasza siła robocza została poważnie uszczuplona przez siły napadające w aktach czystej niegodziwości i brutalności. Teraz nigdzie ich nie widać; wiatry z pogranicza gwiżdżą i kiwają, a ludzie [Root.GetName] drżą ze strachu. Jakiekolwiek działania należy podjąć przeciwko tym barbarzyńskim armiom, muszą one być szybkie i muszą nastąpić wkrótce."
 raiding.14.a: "Pochowajcie zmarłych i poinformujcie rodziny..."
 
 raiding.15.t: "Uszkodzone maszyny"
 raiding.15.d: "Po ostatnim nalocie na nasze terytoria możemy z wdzięcznością donieść, że większość naszej ludności cywilnej pozostała nienaruszona. Tego samego nie można jednak powiedzieć o naszej produkcji przemysłowej. Ze zrabowanym wyposażeniem fabryk i wieloma zrównanymi z ziemią hutami, nasz postęp w rozwoju przemysłowym został znacznie zahamowany. Chociaż w tej chwili nie możemy tak skutecznie ulepszać naszej produkcji, możemy chronić naszych ludzi. Rzeczywiście, podczas gdy maszyny można zgubić i odzyskać - życia nie."
 raiding.15.a: "Dranie!"
 
 raiding.16.t: "Splądrowane zbrojownie"
 raiding.16.d: "Nasi generałowie donieśli nam, że kilka znajdujących się pod naszą kontrolą zbrojowni zostało splądrowanych przez bandytów. Zaginęły karabiny i amunicja; niektóre zbrojownie, które zostały opróżnione i skradzione przez oddziały szturmowe, zniknęły w ciągu nocy. Zakładając, że ci najeźdźcy już dawno przekroczyli granice, okazuje się, że nasze magazyny są wyjałowione, a my mamy coraz mniej broni, by bronić się przed ich wścibskimi rękami. Należy podjąć działania, aby nie stracić wkrótce naszego życia."
 raiding.16.a: "To ich tylko zachęci..."
 
 raiding.17.t: "Zniszczone wsie"
 raiding.17.d: "Otrzymaliśmy dziś raporty z tlących się wiosek na naszych granicach z sąsiednimi terytoriami. Nasi ludzie zostali wymordowani, a nasz przemysł zniszczony; bandyci musieli przekroczyć granice z wystarczającą siłą i okrucieństwem, aby zdziesiątkować naszą obronę i pozostawić naszych ludzi zbitych i pobitych. Setki osób leżało martwych na ziemi w domach, ratuszach i miejscach pracy, a ci, którzy przeżyli, drżą, gdy opowiadają o nalotach. Pozbawieni większości naszych zdolności do skutecznej obrony przed napaścią bandytów, otrzymaliśmy uderzający cios w naszą zdolność do rządzenia tymi spornymi terytoriami. To jeden z naszych najsłabszych momentów i musimy zrobić wszystko, co w naszej mocy, aby przetrwać i odzyskać siły, zanim nieuchronnie uderzymy z płonącą furią."
 raiding.17.a: "Jakie zwierzęta mogłyby to zrobić..."

 #West Russian Wonders
 RUS_wonder.0.t: "Koniec cudów"
 RUS_wonder.0.desc: "Zaszliśmy daleko! Tam, gdzie kiedyś nasz rząd był postrzegany jako zwykły watażka, trzymający się skrawka rosyjskiej ziemi, teraz możemy zaznaczyć swoją obecność na arenie światowej jako pełnoprawny naród. Znalazłszy się w ostatnim koszyku kandydatów do zjednoczenia Rosji, nasz kraj może być dumny ze swojego osiągnięcia i z determinacją patrzeć w przyszłość.\n\nPostęp ten napawał naszych obywateli podziwem, nawet gdy odbudowywaliśmy kraj, jego infrastrukturę i przemysł. Nasze sukcesy sprawiły jednak, że dawne cuda stały się mniej istotne dla naszych wysiłków. Podczas gdy niegdyś posiadanie tych reliktów szczęśliwej przeszłości dawało naszemu rządowi legitymizację, a naszym obywatelom narzędzia niezbędne do przetrwania, obecnie kontrolowane przez nas cuda stanowią niewielką część naszych zasobów. Bez wątpienia będą one nadal inspirować naszych ludzi i stanowić pamiątkę po epoce watażków, ale epoka, w której przechowywanie cudów miało ogromne znaczenie, dobiegła końca."
 RUS_wonder.0.a: "Przed nami niepewna przyszłość."

 RUS_wonder.1.t: "Fabryka Krasnoje Sormowo zdobyta!"
 RUS_wonder.1.desc: "Przejęliśmy fabrykę czołgów Gorkiego, największego producenta pojazdów pancernych w zachodniej Rosji.\n\nFabryka ta była ważnym elementem radzieckiej produkcji przemysłowej i była intensywnie wykorzystywana w czasie wojny zachodnio-rosyjskiej. W następstwie upadku ZRFR wpadła w ręce Nikołaja Awerina i jego oddziałów bandytów, którzy wykorzystywali fabrykę do pompowania czołgów do nalotów na Komisariat Rzeszy Moskowien. Podły los, jak na tak ważny element infrastruktury wojskowej!\n\nCzołgi są rzadkością wśród rosyjskich watażków, co sprawia, że ​​każdy, kto potrafi je wyprodukować, jest siłą, z którą trzeba się liczyć, a fabryka jest bardzo poszukiwaną zdobyczą. Teraz, gdy należy do nas, możemy wykorzystać fabrykę czołgów Gorkiego do wyższych celów niż kradzież złomu od Niemców.\n\nOdzyskanie zdolności do produkcji czołgów będzie kolejnym krokiem w kierunku osiągnięcia militarnych zdolności pełnoprawnego narodu i kolejnym krokiem do ogłoszenia ostatecznego zwycięstwa w Zachodniej Rosji."
 RUS_wonder.1.a: "Potęga współczesnych działań wojennych, uwolniona."

 RUS_wonder.2.t: "Arsenał Syktywkaru zdobyty!"
 RUS_wonder.2.desc: "Zabezpieczyliśmy arsenał w Syktywkarze, główny skład broni wojskowej, który może okazać się decydujący w zapewnieniu zwycięstwa w Rosji Zachodniej. Wcześniej znajdował się on w rękach Zachodniorosyjskiego Frontu Rewolucyjnego, a po ucieczce WRFR z Syktywkaru przeszedł w ręce rodzącej się Republiki Komi. Komi wykorzystywał arsenał do utrzymania porządku w swojej notorycznie niestabilnej stolicy i ugruntowania pozycji regionalnego mocarstwa, ale nawet mając do niego pełny dostęp, nie był w stanie zapobiec jego utracie. Arsenał zawiera broń palną, materiały wybuchowe, czołgi i broń chemiczną, przerażającą kolekcję dla każdego potencjalnego zdobywcy.\n\nZdobywszy ją, mamy ogromną przewagę, dumnie dzierżąc broń, która przyniesie nam zwycięstwo w Zachodniej Rosji. W warunkach ciągłego niedoboru zasobów w porządku postsowieckim liczy się każda broń. Nasza kontrola nad arsenałem da nam cały sprzęt potrzebny do narzucenia naszej władzy nad regionem."
 RUS_wonder.2.a: "Zablokowane i załadowane."

 RUS_wonder.3.t: "Zakłady Mechaniczne w Iżewsku zdobyte!"
 RUS_wonder.3.desc: "Po zdobyciu miasta Iżewsk zapewniliśmy sobie kontrolę nad Iżewskimi Zakładami Mechanicznymi, największym centrum produkcji broni w zachodniej Rosji. Iżewsk był od dawna używany do pompowania ogromnych ilości pistoletów, karabinów i innej broni strzeleckiej. Po upadku Zachodniorosyjskiego Frontu Rewolucyjnego Iżewsk i jego fabryka stały się własnością Władimira Romanowa, rzekomego następcy nieżyjącego cara Rosji, który wykorzystał je do budowy swoich sił reakcyjnych w grze o regionalną dominację.\n\nTeraz, gdy roślina jest już solidnie nasza, możemy ją wykorzystać do tego samego celu.W czasie Wielkiej Wojny Ojczyźnianej i Wojny Zachodnio-Rosyjskiej był on jednym z głównych producentów broni dla ogromnej liczby żołnierzy. Możemy zapewnić, że nasze armie będą uzbrojone w nową, nowoczesną broń palną, podczas gdy nasi przeciwnicy walczą o zgromadzenie przestarzałych arsenałów."
 RUS_wonder.3.a: "Utopić ich w fali ołowiu."

 RUS_wonder.4.t: "Fabryka Krasnoje Sormowo utracono!"
 RUS_wonder.4.desc: "Walczyliśmy długo i ciężko, ale straciliśmy kontrolę nad fabryką czołgów Gorkiego, co stanowi poważny cios dla naszych możliwości produkcji pojazdów. Fabryka czołgów, dawniej z wielkim powodzeniem wykorzystywana przez Zachodniorosyjski Front Rewolucyjny przeciwko Niemcom, od dawna stanowiła strategiczny punkt zaczepienia w regionie, ponieważ jest jednym z niewielu ośrodków przemysłowych zdolnych do produkcji ciężkiej broni pancernej. Czołgi są nieproporcjonalnie potężne wobec stosunkowo słabo uzbrojonych armii, które stanowią większość sił zbrojnych Rosji Zachodniej; każdy watażka, który je posiada, może spodziewać się, że będzie traktowany bardzo poważnie.\n\nFabryka dała nam niezaprzeczalną przewagę w sile ognia i prawdopodobnie będzie wykorzystywana do bardzo podobnych celów przez nowych właścicieli. Daleko nam do zagłady, ale w najbliższej przyszłości powinniśmy spodziewać się większej liczby czołgów i pojazdów opancerzonych i odpowiednio się do tego przygotować."
 RUS_wonder.4.a: "Niepokojąca zmiana."

 RUS_wonder.5.t: "Arsenał Syktywkaru utracona!"
 RUS_wonder.5.desc: "Nasi żołnierze bronili go w bitwach ulicznych w całym Syktywkarze. ale potężny arsenał przechowywany w tym mieście nie należy już do nas. Należący początkowo do Zachodniorosyjskiego Frontu Rewolucyjnego, arsenał został porzucony , gdy Armia Czerwona opuściła miasto pod koniec lat 50. i wykorzystany przez Republikę Komi do utrzymania porządku i wyposażenia wojska. Zawiera ogromną ilość broni palnej, amunicji, granatów i, co być może najbardziej interesujące dla mniej wymagającego watażka, broni chemicznej.\n\nMamy teraz wiele powodów do obaw, gdy arsenał opuścił naszą kontrolę. Naturalnie działaliśmy zgodnie z prawami wojennymi, ale tej samej gwarancji nie można powiedzieć o naszych przeciwnikach; jest całkiem możliwe, że nowi zarządcy arsenału użyją przeciwko nam broni chemicznej. To, w połączeniu z nowym deficytem ilościowym spowodowanym rotacją, oznacza, że ​​układ sił w Rosji Zachodniej uległ znacznej zmianie."
 RUS_wonder.5.a: "Jesteśmy pokonani, ale jeszcze nie pokonani."

 RUS_wonder.6.t: "Zakłady Mechaniczne w Iżewsku utracono!"
 RUS_wonder.6.desc: "Po utracie miasta Iżewsk, a wraz z nim potężnych Iżewskich Zakładów Mechanicznych, możemy znaleźć się w poważnych tarapatach. Fabryka, największa fabryka broni strzeleckiej w zachodniej Rosji, jest nagrodą pożądaną przez każdego watażkę wartą swojej ceny. Jej użycie sięgają czasów Zachodniorosyjskiego Frontu Rewolucyjnego, jedynej siły w żywej pamięci zdolnej do produkcji broni w ilości zdolnej rzucić wyzwanie Niemcom. Fabryka przeszła spod ich kontroli pod naszą, a teraz znajduje się w rękach naszych wrogów.\n\nNa chaotycznych polach bitew zachodniej Rosji nic nie jest pewne, ale możemy przypuszczać, że była to znacząca strata dla naszych sił. Choć nie odczujemy tej straty od razu, spadek zdolności produkcyjnych z pewnością wpłynie negatywnie na możliwości wyposażenia naszych wojsk w przyszłości. Prawdopodobne są niedobory, a nowoczesne techniki produkcji znów staną się luksusem dla naszych sił zbrojnych. Daleko nam jeszcze do końca, ale mimo wszystko jest to niepokojące zjawisko."
 RUS_wonder.6.a: "Wynagrodzimy ich broń naszą odwagą."
 
 RUS_wonder.7.t: "Zdobyto Workuckie Gułagi!"
 RUS_wonder.7.desc: "Gdy nasi ludzie przemierzają arktyczne równiny, pod naszą administrację trafiły okryte złą sławą gułagi Workuty. Mroczny kompleks wież strażniczych, ponurych baraków i obozów pracy budzi drżący strach na tych lodowych pustkowiach; niewiarygodne tortury tego naturalnego więzienia służą jako przypomnienie niegodziwości ludzi. Żołnierze wroga leżeli rozrzuceni po całym dziedzińcu, pogrzebani w gruzach i rozszarpani ogniem karabinów maszynowych. Z krwią świeżo namalowaną na ciemnych ceglanych ścianach, zapach prochu był gęsty, a cisza po bitwie ogłuszająca.\n\nByliśmy w miejscu ogromnego cierpienia i podczas gdy wielu naszych ludzi wyłamało drzwi, by wbiec do środka i poszperać w poszukiwaniu łupów, inni opuścili broń, by spojrzeć na zniechęcające miejsce, które ich onieśmielało. Ponieważ gułagi w dużej mierze zachowały się z czasów wojny, pojawia się pytanie: czy mamy zamknąć to miejsce na zawsze i pozwolić, by pozostało reliktem naszej barbarzyńskiej przeszłości, czy też musimy zanurzyć ręce w brudnej rzeczywistości tej wojny, by Rosja mogła żyć dalej?"
 RUS_wonder.7.a: "Czasami wielcy ludzie robią okropne rzeczy."
 RUS_wonder.7.b: "Nigdy więcej, nie w taki sposób."
 
 RUS_wonder.8.t: "Zdobyto Uralski Zakład Samochodowy!"

The laughter that would always follow a long day of hunting and tracking, when she would be congratulated by the hunters for expertly leading them through the dense brush.\n\nSasha waited there all day, confident that the hunters would, must, return. She had always been faithful to them, and could not fathom the idea that they would not show faith in return. Evening came, and she remained, curling as much as possible for warmth. Night fell, and she remained, watching the curious eyes of the many other predators inspect her from the treeline.\n\nWhen morning arrived on the second day, hunger came with it, and Sasha knew that her friends were not coming back. That there was no reason to stay here any longer, and she needed to hunt besides. But she had not forgotten her friends, and she knew that, wherever they were, they could not have forgotten her.\n\nSasha knew she had to go find them.

He had only been inducted into the Order a month before, and had not yet gotten used to the chill of dawn patrols.\n\nHearing a twig snap behind him, Vladimir whirled around, readying his rifle as he did so. Expecting a person, he was surprised to find a dog, missing one ear, and looking back at him with head cocked to one side. Letting out a nervous laugh, he re-shouldered his rifle and took a step forward.\n\n"Hello," he began, "you look lost. Are you lost?" The dog didn't make a sound or move to retreat as Vladimir knelt beside it and stroked its surprisingly coarse coat, feeling for a moment that rarest of emotions in the Russia: peace.\n\nAfter a short while the dog whined and pulled away, and Vladimir watched it until it disappeared beyond the horizon. He sat down on a stump, lit another cigarette, taking care to hold it tighter, and sighed.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, in a way everyone in Russia was a dog. Just as this dog had lost an ear, everyone in Russia be they raiders, civilians, workers, guards, or something else, had lost something. Russia was not a hospitable place.

Feeling her hunger, Sasha moved to devour them, before years of rigid training stopped her in her tracks.\n\n"Look at that, Pavel!" the older man said. "A trained dog!" He laughed as he approached her, the sound reminding her of better times. Caressing her neck, he directed her towards the trail, picking up and offering the jerky to her as he did. She quickly ate what was offered, and knew what to do next, sniffing the deer trail and looking in the direction of the smell.\n\n"See, Pavel!" the older man exclaimed. "A tracking dog.

Quickly overcoming his sudden surprise, and realizing the opportunity, Sergei stood very slowly and began approaching it.\n\nHe moved the muzzle of the rifle closer to it with each step, but after only two such steps he realized his mistake. The dog knew well what the rifle met, and only a moment after their eyes met the dog quickly turned and began to run.\n\nSwearing, Sergei took a knee and fired a single shot, striking the dog in its hind leg. Bounding over to it, Sergei found it still alive, though unable to move. It whined at him as he knew what he had to do, raising the rifle and firing a second shot. Kneeling down beside it, he withdrew his knife and began butchering it.\n\nHe did not know how the dog had gotten there, what had happened to drive a clearly trained dog into the wilds, and in truth he did not care.\n\nWhatever else the dog had once been, it was now food."

 ### The Modern Bogatyr ###
 RUS.12.t: "Współczesny Bogatyr"
 RUS.12.desc: "Ze wszystkich opowieści o rosyjskiej anarchii, istnieje tylko jedna, która rozprzestrzeniła się od mroźnych krain Dalekiego Wschodu do miasta Kostroma na zachodzie, a nawet w głąb ziem nazistowskiego imperium. Historia wędrowca z nieznanych stron, który niesie ze sobą sprawiedliwość, przemierzając opustoszałe drogi dawnej Rosji. Ten wędrowiec stał się jedną z największych zagadek w całej Rosji.\n\nNiewiele wiadomo o tej enigmie. Niektórzy twierdzą, że to były strażnik Gwardii Uralskiej, człowiek, który opuścił swój dom, aby wymierzyć sprawiedliwość najgorszemu w Rosji. Inni opowiadają historie o byłym żołnierzu Wehrmachtu, pochłoniętym poczuciem winy i narzuconym przez siebie wygnaniem, jako pokutę dla ludzi, których skrzywdził. Kilka skąpych relacji mówi o wdowie ze zniszczonej wioski, pragnącej przywrócić innym sprawiedliwość, której jej odmówiono. Szepty na Wschodzie mówią o amerykańskim ochotniku z wojny zachodnio-rosyjskiej, który utknął w nie swojej krainie, ale wciąż czyni dobro, gdzie wędrował. A w barach syberyjskich miast zawsze można znaleźć dziwne i prawdopodobnie nafaszerowane narkotykami opowieści o człowieku z przyszłości, który powrócił, by uratować świat.\n\nNiezależnie od tego, jaka jest ich prawdziwa tożsamość i jakie jest ich przeznaczenie w trupie Związku Radzieckiego, wszystko, co jest naprawdę znane, to dobroć, jaką okazali ludziom tak przyzwyczajonym do przemocy i śmierci. Opowiadane są historie o wędrowcu, który samotnie powstrzymywał całe bandyckie grupy, wyzwoleni niewolnicy z Permu opowiadają o aniele światła uwalniającym ich z kajdan przed zniknięciem w nocy, a nawet z Moskowien docierają pogłoski o jednoosobowych najazdach na nazistowskie twierdze.\n\nW końcu, choć wiele z tych czynów jest niewątpliwie fikcyjnych, działania tego bohatera, tego współczesnego Bogatyra, rozpaliły ogień nadziei w sercach nawet najbardziej zdeptanych w Rosji."

Przez ostatni tydzień był na granicy, jeden z kilku małych pułków, które strzegły flanki frontu. Minie tylko kilka godzin, zanim zostanie mu zwolnione przez jego następcę.\n\nSpoglądając z powrotem na arktyczne ziemie, mógł niewyraźnie dostrzec coś w oddali. Szara plamka poruszająca się nad tundrą. Podnosząc lornetkę, skupił się na celu. Był to człowiek, ubrany w coś, co wyglądało jak stary mundur jakiegoś rodzaju. Byli dobrze ubrani jak na tę pogodę, ciężka kurtka, rękawice i inne zimowe rzeczy. Ich twarze zakrywała kominiarka i jakiś rodzaj hełmu, którego nie potrafił rozpoznać. Na piersi mężczyzny wisiał karabin, zadbany, prawdopodobnie model świeżo wyniesiony ze Złatousta.\n\nWasilij obserwował mężczyznę, gdy ten podchodził bliżej, mocno ściskając karabin. W końcu mężczyzna znalazł się w zasięgu głosu, ręce trzymał wyciągnięte w bok, z dala od broni. "Halt, co ty tu robisz?"\n\nTajemniczy mężczyzna odezwał się wtedy łamanym, ściszonym rosyjskim. "Przybyłem ostrzec. Bandyci przybywają ze wschodu. Wielu bandytów planuje dziś atak." Wasilij z trudem rozumiał człowieka, jego akcent był okropny, ale rozumiał wystarczająco dużo.\n\n"Co? Cholera. W porządku, chodź tutaj, ale nie rób nic głupiego" - mężczyzna wszedł po schodach i z podniesionymi rękami wszedł do wartowni.\n\n"Ostrzegawczy ludzie, wielu bandytów”. Powiedział nieznajomy. Wasilij szybko połączył się z garnizonem, ale nie mogli oni wysłać pomocy aż do następnego dnia. Wasilij i nieznajomy przygotowali wartownię najlepiej, jak mogli, i nie mogli zrobić nic więcej, jak tylko czekać.\n\nKiedy następnego dnia garnizon wysłał posiłki, to, co znaleźli, zszokowało ich.

They were proving to be significant obstacles to their employer's plans. The first part of the plan involved the release of a small amount of tear gas from the Syktyvkar arsenal into the hall- how they had managed to get a hold of it he had no idea. After the hall was evacuated, he would make his move. He would take the first shot from that position and flee. His co-conspirators had set up in other buildings and would finish off the targets as he distracted the guards.\n\nSergei made for his radio, hoping to get a final check-in before things began, but was interrupted by Yuri's voice briefly cutting in. It lasted only a moment, and nothing was said, but he could swear he could hear a scream in the distance. "Yuri, come in, what's going on?" he demanded. All he got in return was silence. Something was wrong. Looking through his scope, he could tell that security had not been tipped off, they were far too relaxed.\n\nAcross the street, on the roof of the legislature, he could see Andrei with the canister. All seemed to be going fine on his end, but he knew things were falling apart. Once again he looked across at Andrei, but this time he noticed something. In the shadow of the roof access door, a figure looked over Andrei's shoulder. The person was tall, dressed in an old uniform and winter clothes. The figure pulled a knife out of his belt and plunged it into his partner's throat.\n\nBefore he could react, the figure was gone. He got up to abandon his post, collected his things and made for the door. However, before he got far, he began to choke. The gas from the arsenal flooded the room. As he coughed and tried to cover his eyes he felt the kiss of cold steel in his back."

Before he got far, he had slumped to the ground with a deep sigh.\n\nAs she approached the man, she could see his uniform was stained with blood. His breathing was shallow and his eyes had glazed over. In a near panic, she called for the village doctor. The young widow brought the man into her home and set him on the couch. The doctor was able to bind the man's wounds, but it would take some weeks yet for him to recover.\n\nSofia volunteered to care for the man as he recovered. For the first two days, the stranger remained unconscious only occasionally calling out in a foreign tongue. Sofia knew what it was at once, the tongue of the German was unmistakable. Despite the hatred she felt in her heart for the Germans, she continued to care for him. On the third day, he finally awoke. He had awoken in a panic, though it only lasted a moment. The man looked into her eyes and spoke in broken Russian his thanks.\n\nOver the next week, he recovered enough to help her around the house. Each day he would greet her with a smile on his face before beginning the day's chores. Every evening, after dinner, she would change his bandages and they would talk long into the night.\n\nEventually, he had recovered and made known his intent to continue his trek east into Siberia. On the morning that he was to leave, she met him outside the spare bedroom. For the longest moment, neither said a word. Finally, he leaned in and a kiss was shared between the two lost souls.

Andriej podciągnął się z wieszaka i wyszedł z baraków niewolników.

Rzeczywiście, do jego dzielnicy trafiali obcy ludzie, dosyć daleko od wszystkiego, czym interesowali się kupcy.\n\nZdziwił się więc, gdy wszedł na obiad do lokalnej kuchni dla ubogich i zobaczył dziwnego mężczyznę ubranego w podniszczony mundur wojskowy. Usiadł przy swoim stole, popijając zupę przed sobą, jakby to była refleksja. Zebrawszy swoją miskę, Leonid dołączył do nieznajomego. "Witaj tam nieznajomy, piękny dzień, tak?" Nieznajomy zerknął na niego, zanim odpowiedział.\n\n"Witam. Tak, piękny dzień. Zupa jest dobra," akcent nieznajomego był zamulony i obcy, a jego chwyt na język był raczej słaby.

The man had come into town the previous night, to turn in a bounty on a group of bandits, and had taken residence in the local flophouse. As he walked through the streets of [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] he passed by a small park. To call it a park was, perhaps, too generous a statement. It was just the largest patch of unblemished parkland left in the city. Still, he strolled through the area and observed those around him.\n\nOn days like this, without the risk of German bombs, families could be seen enjoying a rare day of peace. To be sure there were not many of them but those that were there filled the stranger's heart with a strange warmth. It had been so long since he had seen such peace among any of the people of Russia.\n\nHe came to a stop at the top of a small hill, scarred by bombs and scorned by the people of [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk]. He sat on the lip of a small crater, looking out at the people he had passed by. Before he could get too far into his reminiscing, he heard a small sneeze behind him. Turning, he saw the source. At the bottom of the crater sat a small girl, no older than six years old. She looked up at him in shock, eyes wide. Looking around for the girl's parents he motioned for her to join him. "Come here, little one. Where are your parents?" he asked, still searching.\n\n"I... I don't know. I can't find them!" she spoke, her voice quivering on the edge of tears. Before she could break down in hysterics, the stranger held up his hand.\n\n"Come along, we will find them," the man took her hand in his and brought her down the hill. They spent almost an hour searching for her parents, but in the end, they found them. The two looked like they had been run ragged, their faces were twisted in panic.

Lev had been at this labor camp for almost two years. He had run afoul of some party bylaw or another and had been exiled to this hell. His breath was coming in shallow gulps at this point, he knew he was nearing the end. He might even be left to rot by the guards if he was especially unlucky.\n\nBefore he could make his next move he was stopped. In shock, he looked at the man who grabbed his shoulder. It was one of the guards, one of the mercenaries that were paid to supplement the garrison. Gently, the man took his pickaxe in one hand, with the other he pushed a canteen into his hands before motioning him behind the crew. The stranger then took his place on the line, swinging Lev's pick with a vigor that shocked him.\n\nLev sat behind the line and drank greedily from the canteen.

The most frustrating and infuriating thing of all, in Viktor's mind, was the man's actions. Unlike the filth who bombed the countryside, he was helping people. He defended families from bandits and slavers, and he aided farmers for only a pittance of food.

However, before he could gut the pig, he felt a burning in his stomach.

This time though, the bandits had fought more akin to a Soviet Guards regiment than any bandit lord's troops. The battle had been fierce, and many brave souls had fallen, but the tenacity of the Guard could not be denied.\n\nAmid this raucous celebration, an anomaly could be seen. In a quiet corner of the bar, seated with some of the more grizzled veterans of the guard, was a stranger. The man looked almost painfully average. His eyes were a simple brown, and his hair was of a similar shade. Of his features beyond that none could remember, the vodka had flown liberally and left holes in their memories.\n\nThis stranger was an honored guest of the Kingsguard, as he had been integral to the Guards success in that fateful battle.

Perhaps even more surprisingly was the fact that their idealism was not blind to the realities of the world.

He was no socialist, but at the same time he could not help but understand the appeal. As he walked, a man in the uniform of Sablin's Red Army approached him, hands well away from his weapon. "Greetings Comrade! What brings you to our fair city?" he questioned with a smile. The stranger was struck by just how genuine it seemed to be. "I am simply passing through.

This is something that could take years to boil over.\n\nDeciding to put the tension out of his mind, the stranger walked down the streets until he came to a small hotel. Entering the lobby, he could see other road weary travelers sitting around the fireplace. Walking to the front desk, he ordered a room for the night and went to lay down. He took off his bulkier outer layers and laid down on the bed. As he lay there, his hand wandered to his left side where burn scars could be seen dominating his flesh. The man thought back to the night he got them, when he tried to play hero and finally follow his conscience for the first time in that damn war. It had ended with his body burnt and the people who he had tried to save dead.\n\nHe was broken from his reminiscence by a scream coming from the room next door. Without hesitation he had sprung from his bed, old service pistol in hand, and bashed in the door to his neighbor's room. Inside, a man in a White Army uniform had pressed a young woman to the wall, his pants already around his ankles and a knife against her throat. He was barely able to turn before three shots rang out. The rapist fell to the floor without a sound, the girl ran out of the room and downstairs, and he sprinted back into his room. He gathered his gear, opened the window and jumped. He would have to find another place to sleep."

 RUS.27.desc: "Witalij Grinin był prostym człowiekiem. Rolnik na dość jałowych ziemiach rosyjskiego Dalekiego Wschodu, kochający ojciec, posłuszny mąż, wierny żołnierz Armii Czerwonej i jeden z niewielu Żydów na Dalekim Wschodzie. Witalij Grinin nie żył, rak pochłonął go w nocy. Jego rodzina, która na szczęście uniknęła uwagi wściekłego Wożda w Zieji, mogła go tylko opłakiwać. Niebezpiecznie było być postrzeganym jako Żyd na tej ziemi. Reżim amurski wkrótce umieściłby ich wszystkich w obozach, gdyby nie byli ostrożni.\n\nNajstarszy syn Witalija, Benjamin, dyskretnie wezwał ochotników do pomocy w Taharze. Powoli przybywali z odległych wiosek. Ben rozpoznał wszystkich oprócz jednego z nich. Był to mężczyzna o wyglądzie wędrowca. Gdy rozpoczęto oczyszczanie ciała Vitaliya, stało się jasne, że ten człowiek nie jest wierzący, ale był zdeterminowany, aby przeprowadzić rytuały. Wygłoszono mowę ku czci poległego ojca. W końcu ciało zostało owinięte w szal modlitewny i prześcieradło. Gdy jego ciało zostało złożone do grobu, odczytano Psalmy.\n\nKiedy nadszedł czas Sziwy, Ben i jego rodzina wycofali się do swojego domu, a goście powoli odeszli. Milczał, siedząc z nimi w ich domu. Wreszcie Ben odezwał się i zadał proste pytanie. "Dlaczego?" Nieznajomy patrzył na niego uważnie, w jego oczach zdawało się przemijać światło zakłopotania, zanim się odezwał.\n\n"On uratował mi życie. Na wojnie. Nie zasłużyłem na to, a jednak mnie uratował" - jego odpowiedź początkowo spotkała się z zakłopotaniem. Co miał na myśli? Czy był żołnierzem Armii Czerwonej? Może dezerter? Potem, z siłą pociągu, dotarło to do Bena. Witalij opowiedział im przed laty historię o młodym niemieckim żołnierzu, który nie posłuchał rozkazu i został zastrzelony przez swoich towarzyszy za próbę ratowania rosyjskich cywilów. Spojrzał na tego człowieka w zupełnie nowym świetle, a gdy zapadła noc, został. Został aż do zakończenia Sziwy. Minął tydzień, a ósmego dnia wyjechał."

Brak handlu praktycznie zniszczył lokalną gospodarkę, a piraci i przemytnicy z Kamczatki byli jedynym ładunkiem opuszczającym miasto w tych dniach. Wasilij był szefem związku dokerów przed przejęciem go przez RPF, a pętlę oszczędzono mu tylko nieznacznie, oczerniając siebie i potępiając związek na oczach swoich byłych przyjaciół. Teraz siedział przed miejscowym barem, rzygając po kolejnym długim dniu picia.\n\nKiedy wydawało mu się, że może sam stanąć, próbował się podnieść, ale udało mu się tylko zwymiotować na buty nieznajomego.

Wydałem ostatni rubel na alkohol, który właśnie wyplułem." - odparł nieznajomy, gdy zaparło mu dech w piersiach. Mężczyzna zabrał manierkę i odprowadził Wasilija do domu, o ile można było nazwać domem jego chatę na obrzeżach miasta. Siedząc na swoim zardzewiałym łóżku, zobaczył nieznajomego siedzącego na starym stołku barowym, który leżał. Mężczyzna przyglądał mu się przez chwilę, po czym pokazał mu starą i zużytą fotografię.\n\n"Rozpoznajesz ich?" Wasilij przyjrzał się uważnie i zrozumiał, że tak.\n\n"Tak, to stary Aaron i jego rodzina. Słuchaj dzieciaku, jeśli ich szukasz, to nie ma sensu. Zostali oczyszczeni przed rozpadem RPF.

 RUS.29.t: "A Sermon at the Edge of Civilization"
 RUS.29.desc: "Alexander sat in the rear of the church, listening enthralled as the Priest gave his sermon. It had been years since he had attended a service. Before the West Russian War he had been an avid attendee, but the war had tainted him. In his mind he no longer deserved the peace he had felt among the pews. He had no plan, not anymore. The only thing keeping him from sitting down in the snow and letting himself die was the promise he made all those months ago in Vyatka.\n\nHis wanderings had finally led him to the isolated village of Omolon. He had heard rumors of a preacher in the far north, an inspiration to the downtrodden in the region. Now, he sat and listened to the "Father" preach from his podium a message of peace and tolerance. His oratory was enthralling and his message was one he could support, for the most part. Alexander could definitely see just why the man was so popular.\n\nWhen the service came to its end, Alexander approached Father Men. He asked for an audience to hear his confessions and joined him in an office at the rear of the building. When they arrived, he sat, and for the first time in so many years he gave confession. He spoke long of his crimes, of his compliance with orders most foul, and of all the people he had murdered in the service of Nazi's and their evil. At the end of it all, Father Men spoke.\n\n"You have seen and done things few can understand, and I can see how they weigh on your soul. Yet, you have done the utmost to atone for those past actions. I have heard stories from the west of your actions. Your past is overshadowed by the evil of the Nazis, yes. Yet your future can be one of peace and love, if only if you allow yourself to move on. Remember the dark times but do not be consumed by them."\n\nAlexander felt the weight on his soul lessen ever so slightly, though he knew it would take more than a single conversation to heal his wounds. Alexander allowed himself a moment to pray before leaving the priest to more important business."

 RUS.30.desc: "In the city of Novosibirsk, a group of men in corporate uniforms marched in the streets. They had been sent by Sibir HQ to intimidate the owners of a small steel mill in the industrial district. At their head was a young officer by the name of Andrei Ugolev, a rising star in the corporate security world. They approached the mill from the south, truncheons in hand. From the north; however, came another group of corporate guards. These men, from Feniks by the looks of them, were armed with rifles and the occasional shotgun.\n\nAs the two groups came nearer to one another a third faction made themselves known. Around the entryway to the mill, a small group of workers led by a strange mercenary sat behind makeshift barricades. Armed with an assortment of old soviet era rifles and pistols, they were led by a well armed stranger clad in an old uniform.\n\nWhen the two corporate teams caught sight of one another, all hell broke loose. The more heavily armed group opened fire, killing and wounding most of Ugolev's men. As he huddled behind a low wall around the mill he attempted to rally them, only to find they had either died or fled.\n\nThe workers let their displeasure be known then, as the stranger leading them shouted an order and opened fire on the corporate goons. The mill worker's sudden intervention came as a shock to the Feniks force, who were just able to secure cover after half of their number were killed. The stranger then pulled a small object from a pouch on his belt before throwing it in the middle of the remaining Feniks forces. An ear splitting bang and a shower of shrapnel was the last thing they knew before they were ripped apart.\n\nAndrei looked around at the dead men all around him, his friends and enemies, and could only feel a sort of numb acceptance. When he awoke this morning, he had been somebody, a rising star. After today, he would be lucky to beg for scraps at Corporate HQ."

The soldiers were joined by a stranger from the west, a mercenary who tipped them off about an incursion by Mengjiang scouts.\n\nLeonid had been hesitant to trust the man, but the potential impact of a surprise attack from the fascists in Mongolia could not be understated. As they passed through the mountain passes into Mongolia, he could tell something was wrong. Leonid ordered his men to come to a stop, the winds had shifted and the air was heavy with a tense air. He saw the glint of the scope a second too late, he was thrown off of his feet as the bullet pierced his side. Leonid fell to the ground as his men scrambled for cover among the rocks of the pass. A hand gripped him by his uniform and pulled him behind a large boulder. It was the mercenary.\n\nThe stranger bound his side and returned fire against the enemy troops pouring into the pass. Dimly, he could see his men struggling to lay down fire against their foes. A small group had made it back to the supply truck, securing anti-tank weapons and ammunition. The man who had saved him barked orders to those around him, rallying his troops to better mount a defense. Thankfully, his men had taken surprisingly few losses, and had begun to slowly push their attackers back.\n\nLeonid glanced back at the mercenary, only to see that he had disappeared. Ahead of the Red Army line, the mercenary ran into enemy fire with an RPG slung over his shoulder. The madman leapt into a ditch before aiming his commendered weapon at the mountainside above the enemy line. With a whoosh, the warhead flew into the mountainside and exploded. The cliff face crackled and began to fall into the valley on top of the enemy. As they scrambled to retreat from the landslide, a cheer rang out from his surviving men."

When he had last been in the area, he had taken hits while hunting a raiding band from the Aryan Brotherhood and the doctor had saved his life after he stumbled into town. The door opened before he made it there and he almost bumped right into the man. He recognized Alexander right away and was surprised when he placed a bag into his hands with a quiet thank you.\n\nBefore the doctor was able to say anything he was already down the street and nearing his true goal. With a feeling of trepidation, he knocked on Sofia's door and waited patiently for her to answer. From within he heard the sound of muffled cursing before the door was pulled open. She was disheveled in the extreme, as she always was in the mornings, and did not register who was at the door for a long moment.\n\n"Hello Sofia, it has been far too long," he said. At once, her eyes opened wide and she let out a gasp. Suddenly he was pulled into a tight hug, his back popping as she gripped him like a lifeline. He was quick to return the hug, though not nearly as tightly, and kissed her on the top of her head. "It is good to see you again, Sofia."\n\nWithout preamble she pulled him into the house and into a deep kiss before dragging him into the kitchen. As he watched her dart around the kitchen and heard her voice chatter away about the news out of Vyatka he felt a smile stretch across his face. He was almost surprised when he felt a sense of true happiness flow into him for the first time in years.\n\nThat night with Sofia in his arms he slept soundly for the first time since the West Russian War, the nightmares refused to come and he felt closer to peace."

An aging, stolid Bavarian launched into a blistering political tirade, spittle flying in the air, as Vasily nervously eyed the rifle mounted on the wall. "...your residence has been classified as Schedule I Expropriated Land Belonging to the Russian People." A quailing Dutch housewife asked what it all meant in the broken German her husband had taught her.\n\n"Accordingly, in thirty days legal ownership of your house and land will be transferred to its original, prewar owner..." A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background. "...and it is advised that you leave the property with all of your possessions by that time." An aging veteran said nothing, but gave Vasily a look of almost-sympathy, as if he somehow understood.\n\n"Please refrain from damaging the property. You will be charged for any damage you do the land prior to your departure." A sobbing construction worker was no longer listening. "The Russian state regrets that this action has to be taken, but believes it to be necessary in order to ensure the just compensation of those who lost property due to the German occupation.

The recent announcement by [From.GetLeader], however, has shocked the world.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood, long thought to be just a bad rumor, has made its existence and its power known throughout the entire world, via reaching out towards Russia and unifying it beneath its iron grip. Swastikas adorn every town as the Brotherhood's leadership deliberates on how best to extend its doctrines over the large territory they acquired.\n\nRumours still spread, as some even say that the Brotherhood may be willing to turn on the Reich it allegedly idolizes should it become weak enough, given their belief that Aryanhood can be acquired, and thus, lost as well. Allegedly, should the Reich decline enough, the Brotherhood's leadership may claim that the mantle of True Aryanhood will pass on their shoulders, and Germany must be brought to heel as a result.\n\nRegardless of the Brotherhood's intentions, most observers have reacted with shock and horror when analyzing the new Russia, and can only pray that it either becomes more benevolent or collapses soon..."

Całe pokolenie rządów, niezależnie od ideologii, zmagało się z tworzeniem infrastruktury lub jakiejkolwiek bazy przemysłowej, a to, co udało się zbudować, często było szybko niszczone.\n\nAle już nie. Miliony Rosjan od wielu dni nie musiały desperacko uciekać w bezpieczne miejsce. Remonty infrastruktury cywilnej i wojskowej postępują i nie są z kolei niszczone. Nowe konstrukcje wciąż stoją. I nadeszła świadomość.\n\nBombowce zatrzymały się.\n\nCi, którzy mają dostęp do informacji z zewnątrz, uważają, że chaos cywilny ogarniający znienawidzoną Rzeszę i jej kolonialne przedłużenie w postaci Komisariatów Rzeszy uniemożliwił kontynuowanie działań lotniczych. Dla tych, którzy są na zewnątrz, wielu wierzy, że jest to dar od Boga.\n\nNawet gdy zwykli Rosjanie świętują z czymś zbliżonym do delirium, inni mówią o ciemnych chmurach na horyzoncie.

Wyglądały ciemniej niż zwykle, co było pewnym znakiem burzy.\n\nZrzucając śnieg z futer i skór, podszedł do swojej rozpadającej się chaty i powoli otworzył drzwi, ostrożnie kładąc swoje rzeczy na pobliskim stole.\n\nPo chwili kontemplacji, kiedy wspominał o swoim cichym mieszkaniu i zapalał lampę, podrapał swojego psa Sasha za uchem i włączył radio, tak jak robił to każdego dnia, i zmarszczył brwi, ponieważ nie zauważył niczego poza szumami.\n\nArtyom szybko zaczął surfować po kilku stacjach, do których dotarł, i nie znalazł nic poza statycznymi, statycznymi i bardziej statycznymi.

Konstantin had been hearing more and more rumors filter down from above, liaisons dictating more and more of what the League does.

He could only be thankful that his orders had changed recently.\n\nThe rising powers of Russia had turned hungry eyes towards the Southern Urals. Economic aid flooded the region, new roads and rail lines were built for the first time in decades, new factories were opened, and the lives of those under the gaze of the Mountain knew a markedly better existence than that of before.\n\nOf course, with these economic incentives came political meddling. At first the influence was minor, a change of policy here and there, but now it was clear that the Black Mountain was shackled to their benefactors. More often than not, Andrei got his orders from men outside his chain of command. Even this patrol, as minor as it was, came down to outside influence.\n\nAs he walked past another shuttered house, Andrei could not help but be thankful. With things as they were, it would not have been long before he was liquidated for his doubts and regrets. Now, the simple mundanity of patrolling the Urals calmed him.\n\nAndrei finally looked to his partner, Alexander. He was a better man than most, though not a good man - none of them could lie and call themselves good men. They had stopped at the edge of the village, away from fearful eyes and judging glares.

The morning had started simple enough, until a messenger was admitted into the council chambers. He was a dower looking man, sent to Orenburg from the rising power of the Russian anarchy.\n\nThe news he brought came as a shock to them all. It was a demand that went against everything the people of the Communes believed in, and yet there was real debate on the Chamber floor about which way to go. For once, the council members were united into only three factions.

I heard it was the Revolutionary Front, or those Black League maniacs," came the voice of another.\n\n"And I heard it was the ghost of Comrade Bukharin, risen again to wreak havoc against the Germans," came Dimitri's voice. Pavel liked Dimitri, he slid him extra rations every once in a while. "The point is, we shouldn't put much stock into rumors. Whatever the truth, we will follow our orders in the end."\n\nIt was true, of course, the NKVD troops would follow the orders that filtered down from higher up, no matter how heinous.

Similarly, the clout we would gain in the political arena within Orenburg cannot be understated. If we can keep Orenburg independent, for the time being, we will deprive our enemy of important resources and ensure that the Communes are more willing to integrate in the future.\n\nWith that said, it is a risky proposition. If they do not back down, we could easily be drawn into a war we are not for. Similarly, the Communes are not likely to be any help of note in any potential fighting, as their small size ensures.

From what he had been told by Colonel Oborin, the bastards on the other side of the Urals were preparing to invade League territory.\n\nHe had known men from the Ural Guard, strong men and brave, every last one of them. The thought of abandoning them to their fate turned his stomach, and yet if that was the order he would have to go through with it.\n\nKonstantin turned from his position overlooking the border and walked back to his command tent.

His unit was currently stationed to act as recon for regular divisions stationed in the interior. His men were a motley bunch, made mostly of old backwoodsman and survivalists who had joined up for a steadier ration count. Despite their ragtag nature, they were loyal and very well disciplined.\n\nAt the moment, Nikolai's men watched as an NKVD man from the Black Mountain patrolled the village below. Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region - even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\nThe subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started.

This means a war with Orenberg will almost certainly lead to them invading us in response. A war that we expect, but aren't quite prepared for.\n\nWe are limited to two options. Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We do not bother with endless debate like the communes. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough... would it be wise to wait?

The deal we gave him was not good enough, and his guard is prepared to resist us at all costs. It seems the Ural Guard does not fear us, and is prepared to try and fight us like they have against so many others. And, ordinarily, we would be happily obligated to challenge them.\n\nBut there is a complication. On the other side of the mountains, another power will back the Ural League up. They have forces that can match us, and they have the equipment to back the League up. It will mean a massive war with another major power, at an inopportune time.\n\nWe have two choices. Either we get involved with a massive war which will only end when the other power is defeated, or we slink off back to the shadows after being confronted by another claimant to Russia.

It states, quite plainly, they will declare war on us if we attempt to enforce our demand in any way. This is, quite obviously, a big problem. Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.50.d: "The lands around Orsk have fallen into total anarchy after the death of the bandit king Oskar Dirlewanger. Towns and villages fend for themselves, while bandits roam the countryside looting and killing wherever they go. With no central government or leader to negotiate with, the land is up for grabs for whoever can take it first. Our rival has launched an intervention, stating that they plan to restore order to the region. This is a blatant land grab and a dramatic escalation of the battle for control over the southern Urals. The unchecked aggression of a full military invasion has put our military commanders on high alert. They warn that if our rival is prepared to storm into Orsk in the name of restoring order to Russia, it will not be long until they are ready to do the same to us. We must consider our next moves carefully, and make sure we are ready for conflict to start at any time."

 RUS_race_for_the_urals.51.d: "In an unprecedented act of aggression our rival has dispensed with all diplomacy and launched a massive military intervention in the Southern Urals, declaring war on every local power there. This astonishing move has ended all hopes for a peaceful resolution to the disputes over the region, and our government and military are scrambling to prepare a response.\n\nOur diplomats are encouraging us to come to the defence of the local powers and declare war on our rival. They say we cannot afford to look weak by allowing the invasion to proceed uncontested and we shall win the undying loyalty of the people of the Southern Urals by coming to their rescue. Once the war is over and our rival has been defeated this will make it easier to persuade the local governments that they would be better off integrating into our state.\n\nOur generals agree that we cannot risk humiliation by sitting the crisis out, but they do not believe it is worth coming to the rescue of the Ural states, pointing to our own plans to annex the region sooner or later. Instead they advocate for our own intervention in response. With the armies of the Southern Urals already busy fighting our rival we would be free to sweep in and capture most or possibly even all of the Southern Urals. This would also allow us to continue our preparations for a possible future war against our rival.\n\nThe third option would be to avoid getting directly involved in the situation while we continue preparing for a war on our terms. This might make us appear weak and cowardly to our rival, and we would be handing over a large stretch of Russian territory essentially uncontested. However, there is no denying that we have been caught off guard and we must be careful not to act recklessly."

On one hand, we could agree to integration into the Russian state, surrendering our sovereignty as an independent Kazakh state for status as an autonomy within Russia. On the other hand, we could refuse, and open ourselves to potential invasion by a potentially agressive Russian power. The third option strikes a balance between the two - by pledging cooperation with Russia, we open ourselves to demands for more and more punishing actions in the future, but maintain our independence in the short term.

Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough... would it be wise to wait?

The power seeking to integrate Kazakhstan may still choose to escalate the situation. If they do we must hope our new ally keeps their promise to us."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.10.d: "Our diplomats have returned with grim news. Despite their best efforts and many offers of strengthened diplomatic ties they could not convince our powerful neighbor to stand with us against their rival. They offered a few excuses about diplomatic entanglements and a lack of preparation, but these were just to save face. The fact is they are too cowardly to stand with us, and now Kazakhstan must face the invasion alone. Our armies are vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The enemy has been preparing to attack for months, while we have had only days to assemble our defences. Many have already declared that Kazakhstan is a lost cause, but just as many others are determined to fight to the bitter end to protect our freedom. We must decide what we will do."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.11.t: "Our Ultimatum Refused"
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.11.d: "Terrible news from Alma-Ata! Our rival has refused to back down from their plans to annex the Kazakh state. They say that the government of Kazakhstan is open to being integrated into their nation, and the matter is between them to settle. If we want to prevent the annexation it seems that we will have to back our threat of military intervention with action. Going to war would stop the annexation, but we may be entering into a conflict we are not fully prepared for. On the other hand failing to invade would humiliate us on the world stage. We would be known as a nation that makes empty threats and false promises. Complicating matters further is Kazakhstan itself. If the peaceful annexation fails our rival will likely try to invade to secure the steppe before we can, making the free territory a natural ally to our cause. However if Kazakhstan is allowed to stay neutral they might view us as the aggressors for intervening in their affairs and going to war to prevent them from integrating into our rival. This would make winning them over to our side even more difficult. The fate of Russia hangs by a thread and time is running out. We must make a decision now."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.11.a: "It's war, then."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.11.b: "We've done all that we can."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.12.t: "Our Rival Backs Down!"
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.12.d: "Excellent news from Alma-Ata! Our demand that the free territory remain independent has been heeded! Our rival across the steppe has decided that annexing the communes was not worth risking open military conflict with us, and they have cancelled their plans for integration. Kazakhstan will remain a sovereign beacon of independence and prosperity in Central Asia, at least for now. However, the diplomatic struggle over the fate of the territory is far from over. Our rival still has their sights set on absorbing the nation into their borders, and now that we have threatened to use military force once, it seems likely that they will be more prepared if we should ever do it again. The people of Kazakhstan may not appreciate us appointing ourselves as their guardian either. They are on very good terms with our rival and many may have looked forward to their annexation. Our interdiction into their foreign affairs will not win us many supporters in the territory. However, what is most important is that the steppes remain out of the hands of our rival, and for now at least that will remain the case. As long as Kazakhstan is free we have a chance to win them over to our cause, but we must act quickly."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.12.a: "Secure for now, at least."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.13.d: "We have been abandoned! Diplomats from our protector have just informed us that they can no longer guarantee the independence of Kazakhstan, and we will have to defend ourselves without their assistance. They have betrayed us at our most dire hour, as their rival across the Urals prepares to force us to accept integration into their realm or fight. Our forces are massively outnumbered and outgunned making any attempt to fight for our survival tantamount to suicide, but perhaps death is preferable to surrendering the freedom we have worked so hard to achieve. The cowards to our north have tossed Orenburg to the wolves, and with our defender turning their back on us their rival will soon press their demands. We must decide what our response will be."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.13.a: "To protect our people, we must surrender."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.14.d: "Disaster! The escalating tensions in Central Asia have finally boiled over into armed conflict. Our rival was unwilling to allow us to conduct our diplomatic affairs in peace, and has chosen to follow through on their outrageous threat. Rather than let us negotiate a settlement with Kazakhstan that would have peacefully integrated the city into our nation, they have plunged Russia into war yet again. Troops have already begun clashing along the entire length of the Eurasian continent. With the outbreak of hostilities Kazakhstan's diplomats have formally backed out of all unification talks, despite our diplomats making the consequences of ending negotiations clear. In response we have no choice but to invade the Kazakh state. We cannot risk allowing Kazakhstan to fall under the control of our rival. Now we have been thrust into the unenviable position of fighting both Kazakhstan and our rival at the same time. Our only remaining option is to crush them both quickly and decisively. We tried to do things peacefully, but it seems reuniting Russia requires yet more Russian blood be spilled. We can only hope this new struggle will be more civilized than those we have already fought."

Our intelligence officers have just reported that our rival has decided to abandon the city to its fate and not risk a military confrontation. Their hope that guaranteeing the independence of the Kazakh state would deter us from pursuing annexation were proven wrong when we did not back down from our plans. Once they realized we would not be bullied into submission their bold posturing quickly collapsed. Our rival has proven to be unwilling to back big words with big actions, and the way is clear to take Kazakhstan peacefully or by force. Now that they know they will face us alone, the Kazakh state has one last chance to accept peaceful annexation. If they would rather perish than go quietly, we are more than happy to oblige them."

After being abandoned by our rival and left to fend for themselves, the communes of Kazakhstan have accepted our final offer for peaceful annexation. Realizing they could not hope to stand against our vastly superior army, the government of Kazakhstan decided that subjugation was preferable to suicide. The Kazakh state will now be annexed into our nation and integration efforts can begin. Despite how many in Kazakhstan feel, there is no dishonor in this decision. By avoiding war they have spared the lives of thousands and the incalculable destruction another war would have brought to Central Asia.

Even after being abandoned by our rival and left to fend for themselves, the people of Kazakhstan still refuse to see reason. They have no chance against our superior numbers and firepower. Perhaps they believe their dedication to freedom will be enough to overcome us. They are incredibly mistaken, as we will soon show them.

In recent days more and more units have arrived at our borders and are stationing themselves in what seem to be predetermined positions. At this point it seems certain that one of our neighbors has given up on diplomacy and is preparing to invade! We must mobilize the army of Kazakhstan and prepare the people for war. Time is short and we have been caught off guard. Our only hope is to persuade the rival of the aggressor to come to our defence.

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.19.d: "In the persistent influence battle fought over our state by the Russian powers, we have finally fallen close enough to [FROM.GetNameDef] to warrant a veiled demand for integration into their state. Already, numerous pro-independence factions within our government are in an uproar over this, but pro-unification elements point to the comparatively weak state of our armed forces, and the fact that a war with Russia would be devastating to our developing nation.\n\nAfter a detailed consultation with our ministers, three plans have been proposed, all of which shall require significant sacrifice. On one hand, we could agree to integration into the Russian state, surrendering our sovereignty as an independent Kazakh state for status as an autonomy within Russia. On the other hand, we could refuse, and open ourselves to potential invasion by a potentially agressive Russian power. The third option strikes a balance between the two - by pledging cooperation with Russia, we open ourselves to demands for more and more punishing actions in the future, but maintain our independence in the short term. The plans have been presented, and it is up to us to decide."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.19.a: "A cause worth joining with."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.20.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Alma-Ata with wonderful news! After significant deliberation the government of Nowa Polska has accepted our offer to absorb their territory into our state peacefully! The current government will continue to administer the region as an interim provisional authority until we are able to fully integrate the region. The army of Nowa Polska and the their other branches of the military have agreed to integrate into our military as well, providing us with thousands of soldiers familiar with the local terrain and ready to serve their new nation. Many feared that Nowa Polska would be the spark that set Russia alight once more, but it seems that diplomacy has prevailed, this time at least. Perhaps we can hope that the days of war across the steppes are coming to an end."

After significant deliberation the government of Nowa Polska has accepted our offer to begin significant efforts to cooperate with our state, economically, militarily, and politically. The current government will continue to administer the region, and the Kazakh state shall maintain its sovereignty, but our interests will be able to significantly influence the Kazakh state.

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.22.d: "Nowa Polska has sent out a request for our aid. Our rivals for the control of Russia and Siberia have been putting immense pressure on the Poles. They have promised riches in exchange for their fealty and the Nowa Polska has no intention of bending.\n\nThe government of Nowa Polska is prepared to make certain concessions for our support. Similarly, the clout we would gain in the political arena within Nowa Polska cannot be understated. If we can keep Nowa Polska independent, for the time being, we will deprive our enemy of important resources and ensure that the Poles are more willing to integrate in the future.\n\nWith that said, it is a risky proposition. If they do not back down, we could easily be drawn into a war we are not for. Similarly, the Poles are not likely to be any help of note in any potential fighting, as their relatively small population ensures. Ultimately, the balance of power in the region is in the balance, and whether or not we act will decide the fate of Nowa Polska and potentially of Russia itself."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.22.a: "Tell them that they have our support."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.23.d: "Terrible news! The government of Nowa Polska has officially declined our offer of integration, saying they will never surrender their freedom or be willingly annexed into our state! Despite our extensive diplomatic operations in Central Asia it seems that we have failed to persuade them to join our nation of their own accord. When our diplomats informed them that we are intent on reunifying all of Russia, including Nowa Polska, by whatever means we consider necessary, they announced that they have already contacted our rival and requested protection against any invasion we might mount. This is an insult to our government and to the dream of Russian unity! Rather than accept our generous terms and take a step towards the peaceful reformation of Russia, the government of Nowa Polska has chosen to try to escalate the situation into a diplomatic crisis. We can only hope our rival sees through their efforts to drag them into a war that neither of us wants."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.23.a: "Admirable, but futile."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.24.t: "The Counter-Demand"
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.24.d: "Terrible news! Nowa Polska has rejected our request for annexation. Their government has rejected our demand after hours of fruitless debate. There were some who wished to unite with us, but the opposing group in the end won out. It seems the only way we will get Nowa Polska into our nation is through bloodshed.\n\nEven worse, the power on the other side of the steppe has sent word to Nowa Polska that they can count on their support if they stand for their independence. This means a war with Nowa Polska will almost certainly lead to them invading us in response. A war that we expect, but aren't quite prepared for.\n\nWe are limited to two options. Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough... would it be wise to wait? A war will probably happen regardless. And it makes no difference if we delay our actions a bit to get in a more prepared position. We could simply take this setback and put our efforts into gaining an advantage."

 ### Russian Diplomacy Events ###
 ### Finland Diplo ###
 russiadiplo.1.t: "The Viipuri Conference"
 russiadiplo.1.desc: "In its short existence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland had rarely been inactive. Orbiting our former overlords in the east as we do, diplomacy has always had its place as the shield of our young nation. The Soviet war of aggression in the thirties had been feared, and diplomats had spent their entire careers trying to prepare for it. Now, the era of Russian unification has set a new crisis into motion.\n\nOnce merely one of many risible "government of national unity", our opponent now stands on the border of our forward line in Onega. Every possible regional rival has been vanquished. Now this unifier has come for the last few pieces of Russian land in western Russia that is not directly shielded by the Germans. And they'll want it quickly, for our military analysts predict the rise of threatening rivals in Siberia and the Far East. The logic of unification demands that the government of western Russia plucks every low hanging fruit as quickly as possible.\n\nRather than use blunt force, this new western Russian state seeks to enter into talks with our government, and has proposed that a conference take place in Viipuri, Karelia. It is perhaps a mercy that this jumped up war band prefers diplomacy. But no amount of words can change the strategic situation that Finland stands alone, that our military buffer zone in Onega shields our population and industry from warfare, and that abandoning it without a fight might invite our future subjugation by Ivan. The Russian's bluster of a massive army crashing onto us does not change the fact that their army is equipped with scraps of decaying Soviet equipment, while ours is modern and well armed. This might be our best and only chance to delay or prevent the formation of a hostile government on our doorstep.\n\nIn the halls of the foreign ministry, there is constant dialogue. Hawks demand a general mobilization order. Doves beg the government to make use of this reprieve to open dialogue with the Russians and see what they desire. No matter our decision, the Russian ambassador waits wordlessly. He probably already knows what course of action we intend to choose."

Both of our nations desire to hold strategic ground that might prove essential in any future war between Russia and Germany, or between Russia and Finland. The Finnish generals remember the first winter war, where the Red Army eventually overran the Mannerheim line on the Karelian isthmus.\n\nA more bloodthirsty government than ours might have not bothered with diplomacy. If we cannot convince the Finns to see reason, then we can punish them for their perfidy. They have seen fit to enslave Russians for its protection, to hide in the shadow of the German hegemon. We will weep for the brave men of Onega, forced into servitude by cowardly Finns. But we shall shed no tears for Onega's backers in Helsinki."
 russiadiplo.2.a: "War it is then."

 russiadiplo.3.t: "Finland Requests Our Terms"
 russiadiplo.3.desc: "The Finns are somewhat receptive to talks. Our ambassador informs us that Helsinki has agreed to a high level diplomatic conference between our two nations.\n\nIt is pleasing that the Finns have not done anything rash, and have agreed to at least give us some time to make demands. Some cynics in our government suspect Helsinki of merely stalling for time to order a full mobilization. The fact remains that war can be avoided. Before anything else, however, Helsinki wants to know our terms.\n\nOnega must be returned to us, its population freed from their janissary duty for Finland. That much is essential. This does not mean, however, that the Russo-Finnish frontier should remain a dagger pointed at Finland's heart. We could simply demilitarize Onega, and sign a nonaggression pact for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Finns would probably accept such a deal, and Helsinki would likely see it as too good to be true... Thus, a better deal would be the return of Onega in full, with our troops in the region. Eastern Karelia will be also be integrated to Russia as an autonomous region, with the Finns granted an open border into the region. This would return to us the arctic port of Murmansk. South-western Karelia and its critical city of Vyborg, or Viipuri in Finnish, would stay under Helsinki's control. Demilitarized zones and non-aggression treaties will follow, preventing any future war between our peoples.\n\nOf course, we could just demand it all. No matter how attached the Finns are to Vyborg and south-western Karelia, their paltry army cannot save them for long. Onega's ramshackle mob of conscripts will not slow us long, if they choose to fight their countrymen at all. The Finns will agree to our demands for Onega and all of Karelia, or pay for their arrogance."
 russiadiplo.3.a: "We merely want our people and Onega back."

Russia wants Onega back, and is willing to keep it demilitarized as a sign of good faith. A treaty of non-aggression would be signed after the territorial exchange, and peace will be the order of the day between Russia and Finland. No mention has been made of eastern Karelia, nor of the critically important city of Viipuri.\n\nWe would be fools to refuse this offer. However, some in our army still insist that there must be a trick to the Russian offer, and that none of their generals have forgotten the shame of the Winter War and the humiliation of Finnish control over Onega. The Russians expect an answer rapidly, and so we must accept or reject this magnanimous proposal."
 russiadiplo.4.a: "We accept the offer."
 russiadiplo.4.b: "We reject the offer."

 russiadiplo.5.t: "Russia Requests Muurmanni"
 russiadiplo.5.desc: "As expected, Russia wants sovereignty over Onega back. They also require us to give them back the Kola Penninsula, home to the Arctic port of Murmansk. To accommodate for Finnish population in the region, this land would be integrated into a new Karelian Autonomous Zone, sharing an open border with Finland and a minimal security presence. The borders of our nations would be demilitarized, and a treaty of non-aggression would guarantee a return to peaceful relations. Additionally, the rest of Karelia will be given limited autonomy under a Finnish administration, with military access and open borders to both Finland and Russia.\n\nAbandoning Kola and Muurmanni is seen as a bridge too far by many in our nation. This is a great deal of land, and many of our citizens have moved there and call it home. Refusing this deal might thus be in our best interests; the Russians might then reduce their demands to Onega if fate smiles on us."
 russiadiplo.5.a: "Tell the Russians that Muurmani is ours."

 russiadiplo.6.desc: "The Russian demands were laid out during the conference, and are widely seen in Helsinki as a bad joke. Couched in diplomatic formulas is the demand for all of Karelia to return to Russian ownership. Viipuri, our second greatest city, would be peacefully given to the Russians. Hundreds of thousands of Finnish citizens would have to be evacuated, and at least one quarter of our industrial base would be given to the Russians. This would be quite generous of us, considering the miserable failure of Red Army attempts to capture the city during the Winter War.\n\nThe Russian demands are no joke, however, for they are quite insistent that these demands must be accepted or rejected in their entirety. These demands for the peaceful drawing and quartering of Finland are too insane to contemplate."
 russiadiplo.6.a: "Prepare for war, and expel the Russian negotiators."

 russiadiplo.7.t: "Finland Denies Our Offer"
 russiadiplo.7.desc: "The Finns have a reputation for being a dour, silent people. Today, their whimsical sense of humor was on display as the negotiators of the Republic of Finland argued that the people of Onega have a right to independence and self-determination. Freed from their puppet master's strings, these unfortunate Onegan civilians now desire nothing more than an end to Russian bullying, according to the Finnish negotiator's logic. This backwater of a backwater Russian province, we're being told, has long aspired to fly free on the international stage as its own nation.\n\nIf the Finns had no interest in diplomatic talks; they could have simply told us so. Now as our negotiators head home, our generals are receiving their orders. We are going to have to do this the hard way after all."

Vast bouts of drinking, dancing and singing have been organized in the no man's land along the border, with the newly liberated Onegan militias joining in to celebrate the rebirth of Russia with their brothers to the east. Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Their presence has not been accepted everywhere, but the majority of our soldiers have welcomed their Finnish counterparts.

 russiadiplo.9.t: "The Back-Up Demand"
 russiadiplo.9.desc: "The Finnish negotiators have pushed back on our demands for eastern Karelia. They claim that they cannot let vast amount of territories be transferred, lest they betray thousands of Finnish citizens. The fact that this land was ours before 1936 has not gotten our negotiators anywhere. Helsinki's diplomats have wryly commented that the 1936 borders must not have been satisfactory to the Soviet Union, as it attempted to invade Finland to correct them. Despite several attempts to reassure the Finns that we will not repeat the mistakes of Bukharin's Soviet Union, their negotiators have stayed on their position.\n\nIt might still be possible to scale back our demands to the return of Onega, sweetened by offers of a demilitarized zone and a non-aggression treaty. On the other hand, our generals have remained on standby for a different type of negotiations. Perhaps it is time to make a more convincing argument for eastern Karelia by force of arms?"

Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Likewise, our soldiers have finally peacefully crossed the border into the newly established Karelian Autonomy, joining their Finnish counterparts in celebration.

Today, the men representing this new government of Western Russia have simply not turned up to the peace talks. As these diplomats have been observed leaving Vipurii, our scouts in Onega have reported vast mobilizations beyond the frontier. It looks like the Russians have only left us one final option: defend our territorial claims through force of arms. Already our generals are sending out the mobilization order while our Onegan conscripts dig in new lines of fortifications. The long dormant Winter War has begun anew."

Ever since we've left the peace talks, the Onegans have followed their masters' bidding and begun preparing for all out war. It is regrettable that we must fight our Russian brothers, but the Finn's arrogance has brought this upon us.\n\nOur General staff's analysis predicts a rapid collapse of the Onegan militia. Beyond them, the lakes Onega and Ladoga create choke points that the Finns intend to defend bitterly. A rapid breakthrough followed by a push into eastern Karelia will bring the Finns to their knees before they fully mobilize!"

 russiadiplo.15.desc: "The Finns have at least seen reason on the Onegan issue. They've released our Russian brothers from their bonds and have agreed to evacuate Onega.\n\nIn exchange Helsinki expects a non aggression pact as well as a demilitarization of Onega. To prove our intentions, only limited military police have moved into the new Onega district, while our diplomats in Vyborg have remained in Finland to hash out the terms of this new treaty.\n\nOur soldiers in the field drink and celebrate. They are joined by many Onegans, and quite a few Finns. There will be peace between our nations, no matter what else the future bring our people."

Eastern Karelia will be demilitarized, and freedom of movement will let the Finnish citizens of the region visit their relatives and business partners in Finland proper.\n\nFinnish soldiers evacuating the region have done so with a heavy heart, according to our scouts. But this is for the best. As our diplomats in Vyborg have convinced the Finns, resistance to this demand would have only resulted in a costly, futile war of resistance. Our army is not the disorganized mess it was during the first winter war, and the Finnish observers are well aware of this. Far better for a non-aggression and friendship treaty to be signed than for blood to be spilled on the frozen northern soil."

Today Helsinki's ever simmering contempt for our army has been amply demonstrated as the Finnish delegates in Vyborg have turned Onega into just another bargaining chip in their dealings with west Russia. Our land is to be peacefully turned over to the new western Russian state.\n\nOf course; this is not all totally bad. The fact that the Finns are capable of having negotiations with this new regional unifier is a proof that this new government isn't made of crazies. Compared to the damned communists, or to the accursed traitors of the ROA, or the rumor of crazy German and religious fanatics, this new government of west Russia is run by sensible men and women.\n\nNow the men await our instructions. Used to their independence, and having prepared themselves for a decade for just such a war, the men might follow us in a bid for nationhood. But such a bid will have to be done without Finnish help. The resulting war would be ugly, and most likely futile. Perhaps it is just better to take part in this new project of the Russian people?"

They claim to be attached to their independence, their former prison in Onega apparently having become their home.\n\nThe soldiers in the field are disheartened when told of this new senseless enemy. Having to retake Onega through pointless bloodshed is a grim new for our men, from general down to the lowest grunt. But we have to get this done. At least the Finns will stand by while we annihilate Onega's madmen."

 RUS_tourist.1.t: "Casting Off"
 RUS_tourist.1.d: "With a compass in hand and butterflies in stomach, he gazed off towards the visage of Anchorage, rapidly shrinking away into the horizon. A game of cards, and a hearty serving of alcohol had certainly done wonders to feed his excitement and wanderlust while they were docked in port, but he had to admit, it was hard to get the yesterday's goodbyes out of his mind.\n\nHis mother's reaction had not surprised him, a quiet bout of sobbing and a laundry list of demands as they stood before the front door. She had been nervous for weeks, and in all that time he had done his best to reassure her. This was something he needed to do, he would take all available precautions, he would have all the necessary documents. It was a conversation that seemed to never end. No, he had resolved any lingering strife with mom. It wasn't her that was spawning such remorse in his sea-bound heart. Surprisingly, it was Dad.\n\nTo say his father was an enigma would be an understatement. Childhood memories existed beyond count; missed baseball games, absent birthday parties, one word responses to kindergarten art pieces.\n\nIt was not that dad didn't care at all, per say. From time to time, he would show his affection, teach his sons to replace a flat tire or two. The problem was consistency, or lack thereof. At any moment, Dad might disappear into the basement again, or a car would pull out of the driveway and return hours after family dinner had ended. He never knew what to make of it. Perhaps the war had simply taken too large a toll, created a man who could only function on whiskey and lonesome hours.\n\nSo when Dad burst into tears in front of the taxi, launched into a bear hug, and handed his son a compass and pistol subtly before the car door closed, he couldn't help but feel shaken. Was he really making the right decision, if it could affect a man such as that so greatly?\n\nUltimately, he brushed the thought away and returned below deck. There was no turning back now, and he had a great and exciting adventure laid out before him. He would return alive, and ultimately, changed for the better."
 RUS_tourist.1.a: "Time to find what's out there..."
 
 RUS_tourist.2.t: "An Unexpected Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.2.d: "At the docks of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a boat has arrived from the city of Anchorage in the American state of Alaska. The only passenger is a young American man named Steve Smith who claims to be a tourist traveling alone, and has the documents to prove it. Determined but fresh-faced, it is hard to know if he will survive for long in the anarchy that Russia finds itself in, and up to us if he gets the chance to.\n\nLicking his lips, Ivan Yumashev's eyes skimmed the report once more, before he set it aside. Picking up a cigarette- a luxury these days, looted from a passing Japanese ship, he had heard- he proceeded to light it with his free hand. An American tourist, eh? That sure wasn't something you saw everyday. It might be worthwhile to come meet this American personally before he leaves, and give him a tour of the fleet. It might, for once, take his mind off of the sorry state of shameful piracy the Pacific Fleet had been reduced to."
 RUS_tourist.2.a: "If nothing else, it'd impress the men."

 RUS_tourist.3.t: "Entry 1: The Pacific Fleet"
 RUS_tourist.3.d: "Visiting Kamchatka was more eventful than I'd thought it would be. Sailors on military ships and on the docks alike stared at my boat as it came to a stop. When I told them I came from America, the sailors all seemed really excited for some reason, and a bunch of them wanted to shake my hand. I felt like a celebrity, almost. That feeling only increased when Admiral Yumashev, the leader of this 'Pacific Fleet' that controls Kamchatka, came to meet me in person. He said the city we were in was called Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and gave me a tour of his fleet. The admiral was really nice and patient, although his English wasn't great; he said he learned it back during the war, the big one, so he must be a couple decades out of practice. Still, it was better than nothing.\n\nSomething was off about the fleet though. The ships are outdated, but they must still need fuel and parts, which I didn't see any industry for, and I didn't see any trading vessels at the docks. I'd heard that the economy of Kamchatka depended on piracy, but I didn't think good men like the admiral and those sailors would resort to it. Still, I guess everyone needs to eat, and if half the things I've heard about the state of Russia are true I guess I can't blame them too much. At least Admiral Yumashev arranged for another boat to take me to Magadan."
 RUS_tourist.3.a: "Land ho!"

 RUS_tourist.4.t: "An American Visit"
 RUS_tourist.4.d: "A boat has arrived from Kamchatka carrying an interesting passenger - an American tourist. People do not usually come to visit Russia from the outside, especially Americans. After all, no one likes visiting war-torn wastelands, especially the spread out and frigid Far East. He probably won't even last a week without freezing to death unless we help him out somehow. We cannot let a naive American die in the wilderness, the least we can do is provide shelter for a few days.\n\nPerhaps Matkovsky could even meet with him! Being an American, he could be useful for reaching the leadership of the United States. We have always wanted a closer relationship with the Americans, so why not start now, when we have one right here! Matkovsky even believes he has connections to the CIA. What fortune!\n\nBesides, it would be a good way to show hospitality. The American ought to be impressed when he meets the true Vozhd of the Russians! No matter what, it would make a good impression will help us stand out besides all the other warlords surrounding us.\n\nHowever, maybe it could be a better and safer idea just to give him a general tour around Magadan. Letting him see the town will show him the true way of life in Russia better than any meeting with Matkovsky. Besides, the Vozhd is a busy man, and he may not enjoy wasting his time with a potentially worthless American. So, should we give him a tour of the town, or should Matkovsky invite him to a drink? "
 RUS_tourist.4.a: "Send him to Matkovsky and find the best vodka we have!"
 RUS_tourist.4.b: "Give him a tour!"

 RUS_tourist.5.t: "Entry 2: Meeting with Matkovsky"
 RUS_tourist.5.d: "I had a meeting with Magadan's "Vozhd" today, Mikhail Matkovsky. He seemed pretty fun and offered me some almost not awful vodka, but overall the experience was rather strange. He kept asking me about my connections to President Nixon and the CIA, weirdly enough. Maybe it's my hair?\n\nAfter I told him I was just an average American he seemed a bit disappointed. Then he asked about how life was in America and what I was doing in Russia. I told him I was a university student back home and I had come to visit so I could explore Russia and maybe have a little bit of fun and adventure instead of my boring life back home. I don't know what he said after that but I think it was something along the lines of how I'll be shot by the first bandit that gets anywhere near me, so oh well. Then I had a few more drinks and proceeded to tell him my dad was an astronaut in a secret mission to Venus as well as back in the war he had killed one hundred Japs with only a pistol. In reality, he's a mechanic and always has been. Matkovsky seemed to enjoy the story, however, although I don't know how much of it he understood. My Russian isn't the best.\n\nAfter our meeting he gifted me this enormous bearskin. I guess I should wear it? I already think I'm fine without it as I have my own fur coat but I accepted it anyway. It is very warm.\n\nNext I'll be heading up Yakutsk to see what is going on there."
 RUS_tourist.5.a: "At least he had fun?"

 RUS_tourist.6.t: "Entry 2: Touring Magadan"
 RUS_tourist.6.d: "I was given a tour around Magadan today. It's a fun town with lots of bars. They only serve vodka though, and to be honest, it's pretty terrible. The seaport is probably only big thing around. Still, there is a very cozy feeling about the place. A weird sort of cozy, because you can walk past a family enjoying a quaint meal and then look across the street and see a blackshirt officer beating up a hobo. Still cozy though.\n\nIt feels like Magadan is the only place around, even though I'm told there are a few more villages nearby. Still, it is certainly isolated, so I hope I can find my way to where I'm going next. There aren't many roads in Russia either.\n\nWhile we were touring I'm pretty certain I also saw a labor camp. Not sure if that was what it was but from the way my tour guide tried to keep me away from it, I'm pretty sure Magadan has a few populated labor camps. Hopefully, those will be the worst thing I see in Russia. From what I expect, however, some places may be far worse.\n\nOverall Magadan isn't all that bad. I do sure hope not all places are like this though. It seems the people have adjusted to the harsh life here. Some in different ways than others, but I'm glad I came. It's time to continue my trip, and I have a long way to go."
 RUS_tourist.6.a: "Still better than Amur!"

 RUS_tourist.7.t: "A Yankee Tourist?"
 RUS_tourist.7.d: "One of our borders posts along the Aldan river has reported an unusual visitor from Magadan.\n\nInitially, we expected him to be a spy from Matkovsky's band of fascists, but upon closer inspection, it appears he is nothing of the sort. The man explained to us that he is an Ameican tourist visiting Russia, and presented proof to support his wild claim.\n\nWhile we have no idea what would possess a person, let alone a well-off American to do such a thing, he appeared to pose little threat and was sent on his way to Yakutsk. We don't expect him to live for very long given his inexperience, but the least we can do is show him around our humble republic."
 RUS_tourist.7.a: "Who in their right mind would think Russia is a good place for a tourist?"

 RUS_tourist.8.t: "Entry 3: Yakutia"
 RUS_tourist.8.d: "Crossing the river into Yakutia was less eventful then I expected. The border guards were initially suspicious before I told them of my intentions. I don't think they believed me at first but, after showing them my passport and the ticket I purchased to Magadan, they sent me on my way to the capital.\n\nYakutsk was peaceful if not densely populated. The people were friendly, but not particularly fond of their government. From what I gather, Yakutia is dominated by mining interests who have mostly bought out the politicians and who commonly mistreat their workers. The miners I met spoke of harsh working conditions and poor wages.\n\nAfter purchasing some supplies and gathering my notes, I said my goodbyes and left the capital. Beyond Yakutsk, I saw little beyond the odd village or quarry and mostly followed the Lena River to the "Partisan Republic" of Aldan.\n\nGiven what I've been hearing about Russia, perhaps hiring a guide or bodyguard would be a wise move. Most of those I talked to seemed skeptical of my ability to tour the entire country and make back to the States in one piece. So, I hired a guide, a former partisan sniper by the name of Zoya Vasilevna Fedorovna (I think I spelled that right). She apparently arrived in the Far East when the Soviet government relocated, and has fought against the Germans. She isn't the friendliest, but she's experienced, and has traveled across much of Russia herself, so she seemed like the best choice for a guide. Since I've heard from the Yakutians how dangerous Irkutsk is, I've decided to go across Amur instead! Zoya seemed much less eager than me, but surely it isn't that bad, right?"
 RUS_tourist.8.a: "They were peaceful at the very least."


 RUS_tourist.11.t: "Amerykanin na granicy?"
 RUS_tourist.11.d: "Nasi ludzie na północno-zachodniej granicy, których zadaniem jest obserwacja kundli w Aldanie, donoszą o nowych przybyszach.\n\nPodobno mała grupa, w której skład wchodzi Rosjanka oraz mężczyzna podający się za Amerykanina, zażądała wjazdu na nasze terytorium. Mężczyzna twierdzi, że planuje podróżować po całej Rosji i dlatego chciałby odwiedzić Zieję.\n\nNasi ludzie twierdzą, że nie znaleźli żadnego powodu, by wątpić w niego lub w jego pozornie legalne dokumenty podróży. Musimy jednak być ostrożni. Choć trudne, a co za tym idzie mało prawdopodobne, nie byłoby niemożliwe, że para infiltratorów z renegatów w Magadanie lub reliktów w Czicie podejdzie od strony Aldanu, próbując znaleźć strefę graniczną o słabszych zabezpieczeniach.\n\nObie grupy nie chciałyby niczego więcej, jak tylko zobaczyć, jak Wożd sprowadzony zostanie nisko i zakuty w kajdany. Albo jeszcze gorzej. Jeśli jednak naprawdę jest tym, za kogo się podaje, oferuje złotą okazję. Udowodnienie siły i legitymizacji naszego rządu mogłoby potencjalnie pozwolić nam na uzyskanie większych wpływów w regionie i znacznie pomogłoby w realizacji naszych celów regionalnej, a ostatecznie narodowej supremacji.\n\nNie wydaje się, żeby planowali powstanie przeciwko Wożdowi, ale oczywiście rzadko można poznać zamiary pasożytów, awet gdyby mieli się ujawnić. Co powinniśmy z nimi zrobić?"

Taką, jaką mieliśmy podczas próby przedostania się do Amuru.\n\nZatrzymany przez patrol graniczny, składający się z bardzo szorstko wyglądających mężczyzn, zacząłem dziękować za moją wcześniejszą decyzję o skorzystaniu z usług Zoi. Dzięki kombinacji jej szybkostrzelnych rosyjskich dokumentów i moich własnych dokumentów pozwolono nam udać się do Zeyi, stolicy terytorium i siedziby drugiego Wożda RPF.\n\nMuszę przyznać, że kiedy w Magadanie opowiadano mi o tym, jak przygnębiającym miejscem jest Zeja i Amur w ogóle, byłem sceptyczny. Ale już nie jestem. Nad wszystkim unosi się ledwo powstrzymywana fala przemocy, poczucie, że jeśli ktoś źle postawi stopę, poniesie natychmiastowe i poważne konsekwencje. Teraz dobrze rozumiem, dlaczego frakcja Matkowskiego oddzieliła się od tej tutaj.\n\nZoja i ja szybko nawiązaliśmy korzystną współpracę, nawet w miarę jak doskonalimy swoje umiejętności językowe, a ona powiedziała mi, że czuje to samo. Żadne z nas nie chce tu zostać na dłużej, więc gdy tylko będziemy mogli, będziemy kontynuować podróż na zachód, w kierunku krainy, która, jak mi powiedziano, zachowała resztki dawnego monarchizmu.\n\nA to ma swoje kłótnie z Amurem. Nie potrafię sobie wyobrazić, dlaczego.\n\nTo był żart, Steve. Lepiej pisz sarkazm."
 RUS_tourist.12.a: "Opuszczenie tego miejsca będzie błogosławieństwem."

 RUS_tourist.13.t: "Agent amerykańsko-matkowski?"
 RUS_tourist.13.d: "Podjęliśmy słuszną decyzję w sprawie przybyszów z Aldanu. W momencie, gdy nasi ludzie próbowali ich aresztować, kobieta, a za nią "Amerykanin" zaczęli stawiać opór. \n\nW związku z tym natychmiast się nimi zajęto.\n\nKiedy ciała zostały usunięte, nasi ludzie zaczęli dokładniej badać ich rzeczy. Kobieta miała niewiele ciekawego oprócz kilku jakuckich drobiazgów i starożytnego karabinu z zachodnich regionów, ale w kurtce fałszywego Amerykanina znaleziono dziennik. A w środku była rewelacja.\n\nZgodnie z jego słowami, mężczyzna rzeczywiście pochodził z Ameryki, wjeżdżając przez Pietropawłowsk. Jednak jego następny przystanek po tym? Magadan. Gdzie nie tylko był mile widziany w mieście, ale miał też osobiste spotkanie z arcyzdrajcą Matkowskim.  Nie wiemy, o czym rozmawiali, ale biorąc pod uwagę jego późniejszą podróż, bez wątpienia dotyczyła nas.\n\nOd dawna krążyły pogłoski o amerykańskim poparciu dla Matkowskiego i jego frakcji, a nagłe pojawienie się tego człowieka tylko je wzmocniło. Niezależnie jednak od tego, choć nie wiemy, jaki był ostateczny cel Amerykanina, wiemy, że nie uda mu się go zrealizować.\n\nMożemy więc być dumni z naszej czujności, wiedząc, że kolejny spisek przeciwko wielkiej misji Wożda został udaremniony."
 RUS_tourist.13.a: "Nikt nie powstrzyma Wożda. Nawet Amerykanie."

 RUS_tourist.14.t: "The Tourist"
 RUS_tourist.14.d: "There has been quite a stir in the city of Chita today, as a most unexpected kind of visitor has arrived in our territories from the East. Our border guards detained a young man who was initially thought to have been a spy from Rodzaevsky's gang, but as it turns out, he was actually a young American college student harmlessly touring the embattled wastes of Russia. Tourists are quite a rare sight indeed these days, but the potential dangers of Russia do not seem to have dissuaded him.\n\nAfter he was cleared and released, he eventually made his way to Chita, and began interviewing several of the locals. It didn't take long for news of this strange visitor's arrival to reach the higher rungs of the government, and now Tsar Mikhail II himself has expressed an interest in meeting this American. While we certainly wouldn't want to defy our divinely ordained sovereign's wishes, perhaps it would be for the best if he didn't speak to this outsider..."
 RUS_tourist.14.a: "We can schedule a meet, as long it is closely supervised..."
 RUS_tourist.14.b: "He can speak to the army instead."

 RUS_tourist.15.t: "Entry 6: The Man Who Would Be Tsar"
 RUS_tourist.15.d: "When I arrived in Chita, it was very obvious that this was a different environment to the one in Zeya. Although there were still soldiers on the streets, the people didn't seem nearly as afraid to go about their business in broad daylight. I thought I'd try and interview a few of these folks myself to try and get a feel for this place, but fate had something else in store for me entirely. One day, I was pulled aside by military guards on the street. I had first assumed that I was in some sort of trouble, but instead, they brought me to an opulent mansion not far from the city. As it turns out, the Tsar who supposedly rules this place wanted to see me personally.\n\nThe Tsar, Mikhail II, was not at all what I imagined. Firstly, he spoke fluent English with a distinctively British sort of accent. When I asked, he told me that it was actually his first language, and he was still learning Russian. Imagine that: the man who is supposed to be the emperor of Russia can't even speak Russian! He was quite humble as well, and seemed genuinely fascinated with my journeys, as well as the fact that I came here from America.\n\nHe became rather distant after I continued to talk about what it was like in America, and proposed instead to show me around the city of Chita. We had a lot of fun, but I couldn't help but notice some army types were following us at every turn. Come to think of it, the entire visit felt rather... off. Mikhail himself always sounded very nervous, and was constantly looking over his shoulder. Security at the mansion seemed way over the top for me. Were they trying to stop people from entering, or someone from leaving?"
 RUS_tourist.15.a: "Nosy Americans..."

 RUS_tourist.16.t: "Wejście 6: Syberyjska gościnność"
 RUS_tourist.16.d: "Czyta była, pod każdym względem, powiewem świeżego powietrza po okropnym miejscu, z którego przybyłem. Ludzie zdawali się nie obawiać władz i szli dalej bez obawy o swoje życie. Przynajmniej na pierwszy rzut oka to tak zwane imperium wydaje się bardziej cywilizowane niż te nazistowskie bękarty na wschodzie. Po dobrze przespanej nocy w skromnym hotelu przy głównej ulicy, zacząłem przeprowadzać wywiady z niektórymi mieszkańcami, aby poznać ich punkt widzenia.\n\nWiększość z nich nie była zbyt rozmowna i dość szybko zwróciłem na siebie niechcianą uwagę żołnierzy pilnujących porządku na ulicy. Patrząc wstecz, wydaje mi się, że nie widziałem ani jednego funkcjonariusza policji podczas mojego tam pobytu. Zostałem zabrany na przesłuchanie przez tych żołnierzy i przesłuchiwany przez kogoś, kto wydawał się być bardzo wysoko postawionym generałem.\n\nByli bardzo nieuprzejmi i nie wyglądali na zachwyconych moją opowieścią. które zadawali, były rzeczywiście dziwne: od tego, gdzie nocowałem poprzedniej nocy, po to, czy kiedykolwiek miałem kontakt z ich carem. Nawet go nie znam, więc nie mam pojęcia, dlaczego tak pomyśleli!\n\nKiedy przesłuchanie zostało zakończone, odpowiedzialny facet załatwił ciężarówkę, która zabrała mnie z Czyty poza ich terytorium. Na koniec powiedział, że nie chce, aby "wścibscy Amerykanie węszyli tam, gdzie nie powinni". Z pewnością nie było to najcieplejsze przyjęcie, ale przypuszczam, że mogło być o wiele gorzej..."
 RUS_tourist.16.a: "Jeden problem mniej do rozwiązania."

 RUS_tourist.17.t: "An Opportunity from America?"
 RUS_tourist.17.d: "Our men along the border with the Whites have informed us that, minutes ago, a small party crossed into Buryatia, having departed from Chita.\n\nAmazingly, it is being led by an American, the very same one who, our propagandists inform us, is starting to gain a reputation. Apparently this man is intending to cross the whole of Russia, east to west, and stopping in as many states as possible, legitimate or otherwise. Though he poses no threat, he does offer an opportunity.\n\nOur struggle against the tyrants in Irkutsk is not well known outside of our lands, and support, diplomatic, financial, or otherwise, could be of significant assistance. If we can prove to this American that our cause is just, we could benefit. A longshot, to be sure, but many said that about our endeavor as a whole, and yet here we are.\n\nInvestment would be minimal. At the very least, the American is likely to be exposed to the revolutionary spirit of our people as he traverses our lands, and it has been suggested that a brief meeting with Sablin himself could compound this. Our leader's natural charisma is well-known, and with only a few minutes of his time it is possible, however unlikely, that should this American complete his journey a favorable portrait of us could be painted.\n\nSome claim that to even entertain such a notion is foolish, and beneath our notice, but many others urge us to seize the chance offered. What should we do?"
 RUS_tourist.17.a: "Invite him to meet with Sablin. We cannot pass up this chance."
 RUS_tourist.17.b: "A meaningless distraction. Let him sightsee."

 RUS_tourist.18.t: "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.18.d: "When we entered Buryatia, crossing the border from Chita, we, or rather I, certainly did not expect an invitation from its leader for a meeting. But that is exactly what we received.\n\nThe border guards had been suspicious, but not overly so, and allowed us to continue on to their capital at Verkhneudisnk without much trouble. Once we arrived, however, we were met with some very sharply-dressed officers, who informed us that Sablin himself wanted to speak to us. Or, rather, to me. What was more, I actually felt that the request was exactly that.\n\nSo, after of course accepting, Zoya and the others were well taken care of while I was shuttled ahead to his office. And, I must say, he seems a most impressive man. Almost impossibly young, with an easy smile, immense personal charisma, and an affable demeanor, I liked him from the start.\n\nI confessed to him that I knew little of the struggle he spoke about, the doctrinal split with the so-called 'tyrannical and bloodthirsty' regime in Irkutsk, but he seemed not to mind, saying only that he hoped, one day, that his state could open relations with America. Perhaps, he joked, with me as the Ambassador.\n\nI and we were shuffled out shortly after, but I found the whole experience most enjoyable. In addition, his men had given us several trinkets to carry with us, and Zoya had purchased several more from a small market besides.\n\nTomorrow we will depart for Irkutsk itself. I am curious to see if Sablin's characterization of it is accurate."
 RUS_tourist.18.a: "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.19.t: "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.19.d: "I was not sure what to expect when we first entered Buryatia. Those in Chita, government-affiliated or otherwise, had said nothing positive about it. A state in rebellion, yes, but also a state of communists.\n\nI feared the worst but, I am happy to say, have been pleasantly surprised. There is a certain energy about these lands that I have not yet found in Russia. A certainty that, whatever the future may bring, those here are fighting for something worthwhile, something better. A 'revolutionary spirit,' to hear them describe it themselves.\n\nI cannot say for sure if such is an actual thing, but the people here very much believe it to be so, and that seems to be enough for them. Zoya herself is very skeptical that any such enthusiasm could carry them to victory over a superior foe, saying that she knows 'very well' how much spirit counts for, but I can't share her pessimism.\n\nAs an aside, I have also noticed that people are treating me, treating us, differently. With more attention, deference, and approval. Apparently word of my journey has spread somewhat, reaching ahead of our travels, and is being received, by some at least, as a topic of great interest. The feeling is, to me, very strange.\n\nWe are soon to depart for Irkutsk itself, where we will no doubt see if the ones who control it are as tyrannical as those here claim them to be. I am curious to find out, in any case."
 RUS_tourist.19.a: "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.20.t: "An American Sablinite?"
 RUS_tourist.20.d: "A message has been received from our agents in Sablinite lands, regarding the departure of individuals from Verkhneudinsk on a course towards Irkutsk.\n\nApparently an American, reported as having originally arrived in the Far East at Petropavlovsk via chartered vessel is, along with several others, now proceeding towards our territory following reception in those of the rebels. While we cannot be sure of his or his party's intentions, we can be sure that there will soon be a situation requiring attention.\n\nAccording to the NKVD, the American in question was received by Sablin himself, and though whatever messages or words may have been exchanged are currently unknown, such contact is inherently suspicious. We also cannot, at this time, confirm the political orientation of his companions in general, and in particular that of one woman who has been identified as possessing considerable geographical knowledge and combat ability.\n\nIt has been recommended by several officers that we treat the group in its entirety as having been suborned by Sablinite practices, and thus move aggressively to capture and deal with them as such. Others, however, have urged restraint given the presence of a known American who has achieved some notability - and thus position in the public consciousness.\n\nWhat order should be given to our agents?"
 RUS_tourist.20.a: "Arrest them, but be careful. We don't want an incident."
 RUS_tourist.20.b: "Arrest them, but be vigilant. Open fire if necessary."

 RUS_tourist.21.t: "Entry 8: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet"
 RUS_tourist.21.d: "Sablin and his people had been very clear that Irkutsk and the 'tyrants' that controlled it would not receive us warmly, unlike himself. And they were right.\n\nThe moment we reached the frontier we were intercepted, as if they had known where we would be. Zoya told me that that was, most likely, exactly the case, our movements reported upon by NKVD agents. Every time she speaks the acronym I can hear the venom in her voice, though I can tell that, as much as she hates them, she also fears them, and that alone is enough to make me do the same.\n\nI soon understood the effect they had on people. The agents were men, yes, but their eyes were cold and hard as they searched our belongings and, after flat orders, our persons, in the most invasive way possible. They accused us of being Sablinites, our denials to which were flatly ignored. Then they asked more questions, and I could tell Zoya was growing uneasy.\n\nA potential disaster was averted, however, when they began asking me questions about my travels so far, and I realized that, regardless of their words, they were treating us with more care than they would have otherwise, for I, we, are becoming known. Indeed, shortly after they denied us entry and ordered us to depart to the south-west.\n\nOur group has not seen the Presidium's lands, and it seems as if we never will. If they are represented by the attitudes of the men who detained us, this is a state of affairs with which I am content.\n\nWe continue onwards, in any case. Not that we have any choice."
 RUS_tourist.21.a: "A tense situation."
 
 RUS_tourist.22.t: "One More Grave"
 RUS_tourist.22.d: "Another message has been received by our agents stationed along the border, and it is not positive news for the Presidium.\n\nApparently, shortly after intercepting and detaining the American and his party, they began displaying extreme agitation to both the questions presented and the searches demanded. This agitation, especially from the still-unknown woman earlier identified by our agents in Verkhneudinsk, eventually led to disaster.\n\nClearly convinced, correctly or otherwise, that they were about to be imminently executed, the woman reportedly killed one of the agents, seized his weapon, and attempted escape. The fight was brief but violent, and the woman killed several more agents before being shot down herself.\n\nAssuming that such action proved the party's identity as Sablinite infiltrators, the agents proceeded to liquidate the rest of the party, including the American. The bodies and identifying materials were quickly disposed of.\n\nWhile we will need to take action so as to ensure that the final fate of the American cannot be attributed to ourselves, we can be confident that, once again, the NKVD has acted as the sword and shield of the Party and the state as a whole."
 RUS_tourist.22.a: "Vigilance cannot be neglected."

 RUS_tourist.23.t: "A Memorable Border Encounter"
 RUS_tourist.23.d: "Always vigilant for potential NKVD infiltrators, the border guards of the People's Revolutionary Council, themselves long-serving Red Army men, quickly spotted the small party approaching from the direction of Irkutsk.\n\nQuickly moving to detain the party, the soldiers quickly found themselves quite astonished at the story communicated to them, first in broken and strangely-accented Russian from the man, and then with more expertise from the woman. Investigating further, their astonishment only grew as the man's travel documents were inspected, and the group's luggage searched.\n\nEventually accepting the story given, and listening with amusement at the 'reception' the man and woman spoke of by the authorities in Irkutsk, the guards permitted them entry into the PRC, directing them towards Organ. They also informed them, right before sending a radio message, that if they were not observed there in short order, the consequences could be severe, indeed.\n\nAs the party disappeared over the horizon and along the road, the soldiers completed their patrol, returning to their barracks shortly thereafter. That evening, over army stew and cards, they spoke with wonder at just what could have possessed an American to go trekking across all of Russia, and what the odds of his survival were.\n\nTheir sergeant won, giving him no better than one chance in ten."
 RUS_tourist.23.a: "But still, a chance."

 RUS_tourist.24.t: "Entry 9: The People's Revolutionary Council"
 RUS_tourist.24.d: "After our most unpleasant experience with the Soviet authorities in the lands around Irkutsk, we continued southwards, entering the lands of the People's Revolutionary Council.\n\nApparently a 'state' created in Mongolian lands by Red Army remnants, its capital, such as it could be called, had all the character of a military camp. And just about the equivalent friendliness of one. We spent some time securing small trinkets and stories from the local citizenry, but beyond that there is, sadly, little of note to write about.\n\nOne thing it did offer, however, was the opportunity to dispatch a letter back to America. For a very reasonable fee, a trader who was soon to cross through Mengjiang and towards the port at Dairen agreed to carry some mail. I hope it is received reasonably soon.\n\nCompared to my interactions with the locals, the experiences I shared with Zoya in these lands were far more interesting. She is a most remarkable woman, capable of easily inserting herself into the cultures of the states that we visit, and navigating complex internal politics with seemingly little effort. She is also, as I have discovered several times now, excellent at sensing dangerous situations and working to either avoid them completely or defuse them before they turn violent. I am again thankful that I secured her services.\n\nWe are proceeding onwards, intending to cross the internal demarcation line between the Far East and Central Siberia. I am curious to see what states exist. We have already seen such a variance in government here, and I wonder if this experience will continue.\n\nI hope it does."
 RUS_tourist.24.a: "A valued companion."

 RUS_tourist.25.t: "A Chronicle from the East"
 RUS_tourist.25.d: ""Dear Mom and Dad,\n\nI'm alive! Or at least I was when I wrote this letter and in good shape. We're currently camped out in western Mongolia, and I guess that means I've successfully trekked through the Russian Far East. While I'd love to tell you about it in person, a letter will have to suffice for now.\n\nKamchatka turned out to be run by the remnants of the Red Navy. Its sailors were quite friendly, and their leader was even kind enough to grant me a boat to Magadan. Unfortunately, they've been forced to resort to piracy to make ends meet, given the region's desolate conditions. Magadan in comparison was fairly well off, its people look adjusted to their harsh conditions, and their leader Matkovsky seemed like a nice fellow.\n\nAcross the border, the Yakutsk republic was dominated by mining companies, and while peaceful it was sparsely populated. It was here where I hired Zoya, an experienced sniper, as a guide to help me on my journey.\n\nCrossing into Amur, I entered into a territory ruled by thugs and murderers, where violence and brutality were common and unrestrained. Counting myself lucky to avoid injury, we crossed into Chita, a territory ruled by forces that seem to think the Russian Civil War still isn't over, with a Tsar from Australia at its head.\n\nFinally, we crossed into Buryatia, a land of idealistic revolutionaries fighting against the last tyrannical remnants of the Soviet Union in Irkutsk, a paranoid state which deported me into Mongolia, now run by the remnants of the Red Army.\n\nWhile I still have a ways to go before I can get back home, Russia is a fascinating land, and I only hope that with Zoya by my side, I can traverse it all. Wish me luck, guys and I'll hopefully see you soon,"
 RUS_tourist.25.a: "Love Steve."

 RUS_tourist.26.t: "A Fresh Face in the Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.26.d: ""An imperialist spy," muttered Pyotr, "has to be". The ideologue of the Siberian Black Army had been pacing up and down his room, flicking through the pages of reports that had been trickling in from the border communes. An American, they claimed, had penetrated the border with a Russian guide (most likely a Reactionary collaborator) and had been visiting the communes. Pyotr studied the papers again, his eyes skimming over the Cyrillic type. This stranger was spinning an outrageous story about being a 'tourist', which was likely simply a thin cover for a CIA operative.\n\n"Maybe," interjected Stepanov, "he's just a tourist. Honestly, Pyotr, I respect your spirit but I doubt the CIA would send a college student who clearly hasn't seen a day of war or labor as a spy." Siuda's eyes narrowed at his military counterpart's words.\n\n"Perhaps he's here to spread authoritarian propaganda about how wonderful his capitalist hellhole 'democracy' is." Pyotr's reply seemed far less fiery than his initial words, Stepanov's assessment cooling his choler. The ideologue's face softened, "No, Comrade Ivan, you are probably right. Still, it could be beneficial to detain him and ascertain his true reasons for being here." He smiled slightly, "perhaps even arrange to have this tourist given a tour of our way of life, ignite the fire of anarchism within him that he might carry it back to America?"\n\nStepanov nodded, the idea had merit, but it wasn't up to either of them to decide, such was the way of anarchy."
 RUS_tourist.26.a: "Give him free rein."
 RUS_tourist.26.b: "Let the Black Army keep an eye on him."

 RUS_tourist.27.t: "Entry 10: The Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.27.d: "Me and Zoya have been in the Siberian Free Territory for about a week now, lots to write down. In the states, I was always taught that 'anarchy' was a bad word, like total chaos. This anarchy isn't what I expected and I'm having a hard time sorting it all out. Everyone lives in communes and are led by councils, which are elected by the locals. I made the mistake of asking if that made the Free Territory a democracy and some young guy in a black and red hat started yelling at me in Russian! Zoya translated for me, and this dude was going off on me about how democracy was just a 'veiled authoritarian mechanism', whatever that means.\n\nTo their credit, people seem generally content with the way things are, but their reactions to me have been pretty mixed. I've been stopped a couple times by excited villagers who smile and take pictures with me, but just as many times I've been jeered at, spit on, and I swear that I've seen uniformed men following me! I don't know what to make of this place. The people are definitely free, but the way they define freedom isn't something I'm used to. They share everything with each other, have total gender and sexual equality, but also live under a military junta. I came here not really knowing what anarchism was, and I don't think I understand it any more now."
 RUS_tourist.27.a: "They have the freedom to be free, but not much else."

 RUS_tourist.28.t: "Entry 10: The "Free" Territory"
 RUS_tourist.28.d: "What a horrible day. I was out in town, just seeing the sights when a group of black-uniformed goons grabbed me and dragged me away through an alley! Zoya was busy with negotiating a ride to the next commune on our list and must not have seen me getting snatched. The thugs took me to a shack on the outskirts of town and interrogated me in a mix of broken English and Russian. I didn't understand much, but I think they were accusing me of being a CIA spy! They didn't torture me or anything, just roughed me up a bit, so I guess that's the silver lining. I was there for a couple hours, I don't know how long, but eventually I heard Zoya shouting at the guards in Russian. They started shouting back, but eventually, Zoya got them to let me go. She escorted me out, and I swore she was going to burst a goddamn blood-vessel, she looked like a giant cherry in a shirt. Would have been funny if I wasn't scared shitless.\n\nAfter that shitshow, she took me aside and told me that I should just avoid talking to the locals altogether. Apparently, I had used some 'imperialist language' and a paranoid anarchist fanatic ratted me out to the Black Army. They put two and two together and came to the conclusion that I was a spy. Apparently, freedom here doesn't extend to thinking big bad imperialist thoughts or using words that are 'un-anarchist'. Man, screw this place."
 RUS_tourist.28.a: "Why does a free society have fucking thought police?"

 RUS_tourist.29.t: "An Interesting Opportunity"
 RUS_tourist.29.d: "Frontier guardsmen, stationed along the border with the Black Army, have reported the detainment of an unusual group of entrants.\n\nThe entrants, initially observed rapidly exiting the Black Army's territory and entering our own, were immediately detained on suspicion of their origins. They were then searched and interrogated for evidence of anarchist literature or leanings.\n\nHowever, it soon became evident that they were not anarchists at all, but rather the entourage of a singular American tourist, himself also detained, who is attempting to cross Russia from east to west while compiling a log of all the states visited. It was immediately suggested that this offered considerable opportunity.\n\nIf the American is invited to Krasnoyarsk, if he can be shown the dedication of the Provisional Government to democratic ideals, and our intent to spread them over all of Russia, we could potentially win a very significant diplomatic victory. Gifts will of course be arranged.\n\nWe will therefore escort him to Krasnoyarsk, as well as arrange both a tour of the city and an audience with General Andreev. We will show him why our state is superior to those around us, and in so doing, prove that the lands of both the anarchists to the east and the madman to the west would be far better served under our control.\n\nIt is most pleasing when such an possibility presents itself."
 RUS_tourist.29.a: "One must not waste such chances."

 RUS_tourist.30.t: "Entry 11: The Provisional Government of Krasnoyarsk"
 RUS_tourist.30.d: "After that unpleasantness in the lands of the Black Army, for which I will always give thanks to both Zoya and my earlier decision to contract her services, we crossed the Yenisei as rapidly as possible and were immediately detained.\n\nThe soldiers, claiming to represent the government in Krasnoyarsk, heard our story and contacted their commanders. Shortly thereafter, and to our surprise they told us we were to be escorted to Krasnoyarsk proper. Zoya was uneasy at the prospect, but clearly not having a choice in the matter, we conceded.\n\nI am happy to say, however, that her unease was unjustified. Krasnoyarsk is a most pleasant city, and as we were escorted through it towards what I now know to be the central government building, all I could see were clean streets, industrious people, and the largest railway junction I have ever seen.\n\nArriving at the government building we were met in person by, and I do not exaggerate, the territory's ruler, General-President Andreev. As one could be forgiven for assuming, I had thought a military-dominated government would be unpleasant, but speaking to the man about my journey and his own goals, I was surprised how dedicated he seems to be to the ideals of democracy, free trade, and more besides. I hope he is successful in his eventual reforms - liberty is of course deserved by all.\n\nWe make next for Kemerovo, to the west and across the Tom. Those here in Krasnoyarsk are quick to speak negatively of the city, the state it resides in, and its ruler, but I have learned by now that what people say is often not entirely representative.\n\nIn any case, we shall certainly see."
 RUS_tourist.30.a: "A surprising government, indeed."

 RUS_tourist.31.t: "A Strange Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.31.d: "An odd occurrence has been reported to us from our security forces arranged along the border with Krasnoyarsk. Apparently an American, of all people, appeared and subsequently requested entry into the Principality!\n\nAlthough initially detained on suspicion of being an infiltrator from Andreev's traitorous regime, the man provided ample proof of both his American citizenship as well as his continued journey across Siberia, from Petropavlovsk to, so far, Krasnoyarsk. He further explained that he is on a journey across Russia from East to West, visiting as many nations as possible and investigating their cultures.\n\nWith no reason to detain the American further, and no instructions from the central government to reject entry, he was permitted to continue through the border region. He is expected to arrive in Kemerovo itself in short order."
 RUS_tourist.31.a: "How curious."
 
 RUS_tourist.32.t: "Entry 12: The Principality of Kemerovo"
 RUS_tourist.32.d: "When I first crossed into Kemerovo, I thought that everything I had been told in Krasnoyarsk was true - the border guards were most unfriendly until I proved who I was. But having now been in Kemerovo for a few days, I see that things are not as I thought they would be.\n\nThe city is clean and orderly, as long as you ignore all the coal dust from the Kuznetsk basin, the people seem relatively friendly, and I'm certainly not seeing all the unpleasantness I did in Zeya, Irkutsk, or in the territory of the Black Army. Zoya certainly seems to enjoy it, at the very least.\n\nFar stranger than the city, however, is the government. As far as I can tell their ruler is a Red Army general who had a breakdown and began calling himself 'Emperor' Rurik II, and it doesn't seem like anyone can really explain to me what his actual goals are. The ones they can tell me about, however and very loudly, are his children - 'Prince' Yuriy and 'Princess' Lydia.\n\nYuriy seems to have some ideas similar to Valery regarding unions and the like, and wants to move towards a democratic system. His sister seems much harsher, wanting to continue absolutism and claiming it a simple necessity towards keeping order in a place as lawless as Siberia. It shook me a little how much sense that made to me - before I set sail I would have supported Yuriy absolutely, but after what I've seen so far in Siberia I can't discount Lydia's opinion so easily anymore.\n\nIn any case, I've spoken with Zoya and tomorrow we'll be heading south, towards Biysk, apparently the capital of a small nation of Orthodox Old Believers. I wonder what that will be like."
 RUS_tourist.32.a: "I wonder which sibling will win?"

 RUS_tourist.33.t: "The Land of Two People"
 RUS_tourist.33.d: "The strange group reached Gorno-Altaysk in the early morning. Local militias were confused about the newcomers. Couldn't be merchants from beyond the frontier; they had no wares. Neither could they be locals heading either to church or to the day's festival. In front of the group was a woman, clinging to her rifle. Next to her was a foreigner with a dreadful Russian, claiming over and over to be an American.\n\nAs often was the case, President Zavoloko was the one to break the deadlock. He asked for fresh clothes to be provided to the group. The foreigner would stand out much less in traditional Altay clothes. From there Zavoloko had the American shown to a local church. In late afternoon he would be free to attend a local Burkhanist festival, where songs would shared under Oyrotia's endless sky.\n\nThe bodyguard was welcomed in for questioning. After assessing that the group really were just travellers, and had no tie to any Central Siberian factions, Zavoloko politely requested from the woman as much information as possible on Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk and the Siberian Black Army. The region was waking, and dark clouds were on the horizon. Any information as to developments in Central Siberia was welcome in the isolated republic."
 RUS_tourist.33.a: "Is it true, then, that General Krylov has gone mad?"

 RUS_tourist.34.t: "Entry 13: The Republic of Oyrotia"
 RUS_tourist.34.d: "It seems I was ill informed. While everyone in Central Siberia has referred to Oyrotia as a nation of Old Believers ( the Russian Orthodox Schismatics exiled from Western Russia to this remote place), in fact the Oyrotian Republic is home to a large amount of Altaic people. I was invited to a festival, where songs and burning of sacred plants were carried on. I didn't understand much of the rituals, but there did not seem to be any shaman leading proceedings. It was a more communal sort of ceremony. The locals seemed indifferent to my presence.\n\nThe capital of the republic is not too different from any provincial town I've seen so far. Unlike Kemerovo or Krasnoyarsk, it seems this region has merely been forgotten by events. Isolated here in the mountains, it seems the two peoples of the republic want nothing more than peace and quiet. The lack of border guards and military checkpoints was commented on by Zoya. Hopefully peace continues to safeguard these people.\n\nWe've been sold horses! At a good price, too, it seems. It will help us make good time as we go down the mountains and head toward Novosibirsk. A merchant travelling in the direction will make the trip with us. It will be interesting to return to civilization, I hear Novosibirsk is one of the last big industrial cities in Russia."
 RUS_tourist.34.a: "The journey continues."

 RUS_tourist.35.t: "The Mile High Tour"
 RUS_tourist.35.d: "This morning, a bunch of horsemen in a caravan from Oyrotia stopped by while doing some trade outside of Iskitim. While the supplies they brought over were well needed, the Oyrotians brought a peculiarity with them. That is, one horseman was carrying an American flag. The traveler looked both incredibly like he belonged with the caravan, and yet incredibly out of place due to his body language and general appearance. Regardless, he was trading alongside our citizens and seemingly happy.\n\nAnd then he ran into some soldiers. Soldiers who he did not stop talking to.\n\n"My name is Steve, and I'm a tourist from America! I've heard of the aircraft plant here, and have seen your planes soar all throughout this part of Siberia! They're absolutely fascinating to me."\n\nWhile his Russian was rather broken and he could barely hold a coherent conversation, he was traveling with a native who explained his situation. Zoya, as she was called, gave context to Steve's story and explained his desire to travel the Russian warlord states in order to document his experiences. Of course, the soldiers wouldn't pass on an opportunity for some entertainment. They offered to take him to the capital, where they would "commandeer" an aircraft.\n\nSteve and Zoya generously accepted, and the soldiers decided to drive them to the capital. While on the way, Steve was spinning eccentric, heartfelt tales about his previous travels from Eastern Siberia. This enchanted most of the soldiers, yet two of the most serious of the bunch, Evgeny and Anatoly, were infighting about which plane to take the young American up in.\n\n"I'm telling you, Anatoly! He would love the old Soviet Il-10. Americans eat up that historical stuff."\n\n"Nah, nah! Amerikanskiy love fast and dangerous! We should take out the jet plane that Aleksandr was working on."\n\nAfter much debate, the two come to a consensus with the other soldiers alongside Steve, and decided that..."

 RUS_tourist.36.t: "Entry 14: Taking to the Skies"
 RUS_tourist.36.d: "Russia is truly a sight to behold from her skies.\n\nWhile I have come to the Anarchy by sea and have traveled it by land, to soar among the clouds before the Urals is a lovely sight to behold. The soldiers of Novosibirsk were enamored by my tales, and decided to bring out an old piece of history from the German conflict; an old Soviet Il-10 from the late 40s.\n\nShe served a bit in the West Russian War; engaging a few overconfident ME-262s and providing ground support when she was able. Almost shot down in a fierce dogfight over Moscow, she was valiantly spared... or so my pilot Evgeny told me. Whether this was true or not, I did not mind. The only thing that mattered was my head among the literal clouds and his comfort in this old piece of history.\n\nWhile we stayed within the borders of Novosibirsk and mostly along the Ob River, the sights and sounds of the serene Siberian countryside are absolutely breathtaking to behold from the sky, and it is surely something I will never forget, nor can do justice in this entry. When we landed, Evgeny gave me a brotherly hug goodbye, and gave me instructions to safely head to Tomsk.\n\n"Travel safe, Tovarish. May your journey be marked with heartfelt success." Those words will echo in my head for a very, very long time, and the appreciation deep in my heart can never be expressed fondly enough."

 RUS_tourist.37.t: "An Unfortunate Aviation Accident"
 RUS_tourist.37.d: "The air above Kuybyshev was crisp and bright. Sparse clouds made way for the shining sun to lay on the village grounds, with nature following the sun in suit. Despite the occasional threat by warlord raiders, it was a surprisingly normal day in the average Novosibirsk town.\n\nUntil, that is, a jet fighter slammed into the farmland of Mr. Kravchenko and subsequently burst into flames on impact. Some may have thought it to be a lone, lost German bomber which had wandered way too far and was shot down by the Free Aviators, while others thought it was a simple air training exercise gone wrong. On closer inspection, the aircraft was either an experimental Soviet jet which never got off the ground, or a makeshift science experiment by one of the warlords in their vain attempt at air supremacy. Regardless, the smouldering wreck of what is left makes it impossible to discern.\n\nAfter an examination, the village constabulary has determined that three bodies were on the plane, all of which perished during the crash or the subsequent engine explosion. One of the corpses, although brutally disfigured, was an interesting case. The diary he was clutching to his chest was badly burned, yet contained stories of other warlord states throughout Russia in a language which the village intellectuals determine to be English.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the loss of most of the pages to fire and the overall integrity of his diary, it seems his story will be lost to the very flames which burned his mark on this world away."
 RUS_tourist.37.a: "What remains will be buried in an unmarked grave."

 RUS_tourist.38.t: "An American in Tomsk?"
 RUS_tourist.38.d: "Sightings of a strange group entering Tomsk have perplexed many recently. Riding horses and dressed in Altaic outfits while carrying the American flag, we have knowledge that this is actually an American who has been traveling all across Russia and has now entered our city of Tomsk.\n\nWhile Tomsk already invites many strange people for its promises of freedom and liberty, this entourage is especially interesting. Never has an American traveled so far into Siberia! Almost everyone in the city has a desire to meet him, and he has gained a fair bit of fame. We have even set up plans for him to view a debate in the salons as well as showing him into the insights of our unique government. As an American, he will surely be impressed with Russia's most powerful democracy, won't he?\n\nNevertheless, we must commend him on his willingness to learn. Traveling across all of Russia is not for the faint of heart! There are even rumors that he is a university student back home in America. He must be a great scholar!"
 RUS_tourist.38.a: "He will be safe here!"

 RUS_tourist.39.t: "Entry 15: The City of Artists"
 RUS_tourist.39.d: "Tomsk is very different from every other place I have visited so far. To be fair, however, almost every place in Russia is different from the next. It only gets stranger the deeper into Russia I get.\n\nI was welcomed with open arms into Tomsk, and the people here seem to be very friendly for the most part. Almost everyone wanted to meet me and have a discussion. I don't think I have been anywhere else that spoke more about politics, science, and art than here in Tomsk.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I even got a little insight into how Tomsk operates myself. I was invited to view a salon, and to be honest, it was entirely baffling. I had no idea what was going on. It was all just a bunch of intellectual conversation and scholarly arguing. I couldn't even figure out what they were talking about, and my Russian has gotten far better than when I arrived here in Russia! While I may not really understand this place, but it's good to know there are democracies in Russia and not just warlord dictatorships ruling over the people. Maybe Russia does have hope...\n\nStill, I don't know how they all agree on anything. It's much more enjoyable outside in the city of Tomsk than in the salons. The politics here are like if every nerd back in university decided to make a country. Who knows, maybe they know something I don't.\n\nNext, I'll be heading to Omsk. And even though people have said I should avoid that hell if I like to have my life, I'll keep an open mind. It can't be that bad, can it?"
 RUS_tourist.39.a: "Does he really have to go there?"

 RUS_tourist.40.t: "Caravans from the East"
 RUS_tourist.40.d: "A refugee convoy has rolled in from Eastern Siberia sometime this afternoon, and with it came potential new members of the Black League. Destitute men looking for safety, security, brotherhood, purpose... Perfect men to support our journey to the Great Trial.\n\nAnd then there was the American.\n\nWhile his name is unknown to the many around him, and his Russian dialect is just as much as a mystery, he is carrying an American flag and traveling with another companion. The companion, while not a local to the Western Siberia area, is clearly a native Russian. Cadre 120996, assigned to protection and border security duty, raised a complaint to their local officer in the League about this strange traveler. The commanding officer of the Cadre expressed caution, but out of sheer curiosity allowed passive interrogation and conversation with the traveler. He revealed himself to be a man called Steve, traveling the Russian anarchy with a guide who refers to herself as Zoya. Steve is documenting his experiences and the individual stories of the entire span of the country, of which his current stop is the great city of Omsk.\n\nWhile we are indeed overly cautious about visitors; especially ones as eccentric as an American tourist mad enough to traverse the warlord states, the commanding officer of Cadre 120996 has instructed his men to give the tourist some "friendly advice", and to show him around the city a bit. The only problem is that Steve seems dead set on some advice Zoya has told him; advice which goes directly against our own. After a long conversation and our friendly offer, the tourist makes his decision."
 RUS_tourist.40.a: "He approves of our guidance."
 RUS_tourist.40.b: "That blasted American tells us off!"

 RUS_tourist.41.t: "Entry 16: The Wonderful City of Omsk"
 RUS_tourist.41.d: "Omsk is perhaps one of the safest and cleanest cities in Russia as of yet. While I am not one to take a side on politics, their governance allows extreme order, yet compassion to everyday citizens.\n\nMembers of the "Black League", which is both the leading authority and armed paramilitary force of the nation, offered very generously to safely and courteously show us around! Despite the protests of Zoya (she refers to me as a "Mudak" in private later amid other chastising), the Black League shows us important cultural sights, an insight into how their society works, let us watch a military drill, and took us to a lovely local stew shop run by an old man called Pyetr. After this, the Black League hurried us to a local Hostel underground as to not be accosted by the Luftwaffe nor be out and about in the city late at night. The beds we slept in were sturdy and comfy, and despite the fact that we were essentially sleeping in concrete subway tubes, everything felt homey and warm.\n\nThis morning, we are to travel toward the Urals the way of Tyumen alongside a military caravan. Zoya tells me that it's essentially a glorified raid. While cautious, I severely doubt that the Black League would send a traveler they have treated so warmly into live combat. Nevertheless, I am departing in a few hours, and will be writing a letter back home to share my story thus far."
 RUS_tourist.41.a: ""Strange, but safe. That's how I like it.""
 
 RUS_tourist.42.t: "The Horrors of The Black League"
 RUS_tourist.42.d: "Such a foolish tourist. The foreign madman had the audacity to reject the advice of our glorious League, instead trusting in the local Zoya to serve as his compass. It is clear that this "Steve" is nothing but another obstacle; a test to the people of Omsk sent by the corrupt Western superpower to stop our soul-wrenching progress toward the Great Trial. His recorded observations are nothing more than petty espionage, espionage which will be sold to an American-backed warlord and used to crush us. Every notation that he makes rolls our clock forward, and our League cannot afford that.\n\nFortunately, "Steve" has reinforced his lack of intelligence and overconfidence during his fleeting few minutes here. About a half hour after the confrontation with Cadre 120996, "Steve" wanders into Bunker 2938 in order to find some information and a potential place to spend the night. Cadre 482315 has reserved most of that bunker for interrogation of individuals who have sought harm to the Russian nation. One such wastrel, an intellectual by the name of Yusef, happened to barely make a futile attempt at freedom. Escaping from his binds, the now half-blinded scoundrel could not see "Steve", yet still called out to him. His fingers individually broke and his spirit broken, Yusef would stumble into a horrified "Steve" as he collapsed to the ground and expired from shock. A few moments later, League members from Cadre 482315 would shoot two bullets from a TT-33 pistol into the back of "Steve's" skull.\n\nHis companion, Zoya, was found fleeing from Cadre 384234 after hearing this exchange from outside, and was swiftly executed with eleven PPSH shots. Both of their corpses will be offloaded in tomorrow's excursion into Tyumen, as ordered from Comrade Yazov himself, who was seemingly happy with this unique turn of events. Nobody, not even curious outsiders, will impede our march toward the Great Trial."

 RUS_tourist.43.d: "Dear Mom and dad,\n\nI am well, as is Zoya, who's been a godsend. I'm in a city called Omsk right now. The guys in charge here are called the Black League and let me tell you they run a tight ship! They're the ones who helped me get this letter to you! And through Kazakhstan, too! Ain't that nuts?\n\nThe farther I travel, the more of Russia there seems to be. The first city I visited was Kansk, run by the "Black Army." (No relation to the Black League, don't get confused!) They didn't like me very much. They stalked us and I got accused of being an "authoritarian," which was just madness. I'm American! We're as free as it gets! The city of Krasnoyarsk was much more pleasant. It wasn't big, but it was clean, industrious. The man in charge, Andreev, was very personable. He wants to set up a democracy, but for now it's a military junta. To the west was Kemerovo. I didn't meet the ruler - some old Red Army general that thinks he's an ancient Russian king, which is weird - but the people were nice. After that I went to Oyrotia, a small nation of Altaic people (one of Russia's ethnicities, like the Indians back home). They were very down to earth and sold me some horses and a beautiful cloak I can't wait to show you. Novosibirsk, on the other hand, is a big city, kinda like Baltimore. They took me up in an old Soviet warplane and Ma, it was breathtaking. The ride of a lifetime. The last place I visited was Tomsk, which is run by a bunch of those intellectual types, but at least it's a democracy.\n\nI'll write again as soon as I can. So far it seems that Russia defies almost all expectations, but with Zoya by my side I'm sure I'll be safe. I'll see you soon!"

 RUS_tourist.44.d: "Comrade Major,\n\nA potential threat to the security of the People's Republic has been observed. Unusual particulars have necessitated this message.\n\nObservation units under my command have reported the appearance of a party of individuals attempting to enter the People's Republic from the territory of the Black League. The intruders do not match any known previous classification parameters for infiltrators. Their appearance and attire is unconcerned with camouflage, their mode of transport, that of horseback, is too conspicuous, and their path is exposed, providing no concealment. In addition, the party is carrying a raised American flag, further increasing visibility.\n\nIt has been suggested by subordinates that such a radical change in potential tactics of infiltration is likely an attempt to discover operational practices and procedures, or similarly as an attempt to capture security forces for information extraction. However, previous efforts on the part of the league to do so have focused on covert abduction, and were such to be attempted by the intruders as observed, long-range fire would likely ensure rapid neutralization.\n\nI await orders on how to proceed with interception.\n\nIn defense of the Central Committee,\n\nG.A.

But, as we soon discovered, and much to our peril, that healthy communist paranoia is still alive and strong.\n\nWhen I saw the border patrol approaching, I naively assumed that they would, like in so many other of the states we have crossed, cautiously advance, ensure we were not hostile, and then check our documents. They completed that first step, but then, and without even so much as speaking to us, proceeded directly to shooting. And if it had not been for Zoya using her practiced eye to read their body language, my story might have ended there.\n\nFortunately for us, she later told me, they had not waited long enough to both ensure accuracy and also prevent escape. We all immediately took off, pushing our horses to their very limits in order to remain ahead of the vehicles driven by the border patrol. Again Zoya proved her considerable skills, quickly identifying terrain that the horses could progress through, but the vehicles themselves could not. After several hours of hard riding, with the horses pushed to utter exhaustion, and using my continued ability to write as evidence, we succeeded in evading our pursuers.\n\nClearly unwelcome in these lands, we progress in the only direction possible - north - skirting the lands of those strange democrats in Tomsk. Zoya tells me that even she is excited by our next destination.\n\nI hope that, once there, I am similarly so."

Upon approach, the intruders were observed to be momentarily paralyzed with indecision, before one attempted rapid movement in an opposed direction.\n\nUnderstanding this as an attempt at escape, and therefore providing tentative identification of the intruders as Black League infiltrators, I ordered engagement to begin at 14:7:25.\n\nContributory fire from armored units affected rapid neutralization, with responding gunfire only briefly observed from the party's sole female member. Upon ensuring that the intruders were deceased, they and their possessions were briefly searched before said remains and possessions were cremated in order to ensure the failure of subsequent potential active or passive surveillance.\n\nA catalog of items is attached to this message, and attention should be drawn to the presence of extremely convincing forgeries of various American and Siberian travel documents.\n\nIn defense of the Central Committee,\n\nG.A.

More perplexing was the apparent presence of an American flag amongst the other laden cargo.\n\nAlthough the pilot considered engaging the party using his onboard armament, as is usual with unannounced border crossings, the odd nature of the situation resulted in his communication instead. From their direction of travel, the party appeared to be moving in the direction of the Thief Territory, though this path could carry them within close proximity of our aerodromes near Surgut.\n\nIt has been suggested that, to minimize potential confrontations, we should avoid contact, unless they attempt to directly breach the security perimeter of any of our forward bases.

 RUS_tourist.48.d: "Ever since entering Western Siberia, fleeing for the cover of forests or, if in a city, the ever-present slit trenches, has been a regular occurrence. Zoya tells me it's because the Germans have been bombing everything they can see for years on end, and from the destruction everywhere I look, I can see the awful effect.\n\nBut whenever I hear anyone talk about the bombers, they also talk, with hushed reverence, about the Aviators. Zoya seems enamored by them, remembering them from her younger days behind the German lines. But though she says we've entered their territory, we haven't seen any of them. At least not on the ground - one small plane keeps us under watch at all times. Zoya says they're being careful, and that German infiltrators have tried to sabotage them before.\n\nThe one thing we have seen, from a distance and through my binoculars, was a group of biplanes performing some exercises in the distance. I must say, I can see where the stories about the Aviators' flying prowess come from - I've never seen planes turn so radically, or fly so low, and come out unscathed. I suppose you would have to be incredibly skilled in order to fly wood and canvas machines powered by tractor engines against the Luftwaffe for years on end.\n\nWithout any contact with the Aviators themselves, we're continuing west, where I've been told there is an entire region under the control of a vicious bandit clan. I'm not yet sure whether to believe it.\n\nZoya tells me we should reach their territory within a few days. We'll see how true the stories were then."

 RUS_tourist.49.d: "Some of our brothers, watching the frontier near Nyagan, have reported a small party on horseback entering our territory from that claimed by the Aviators.\n\nThey have not spoken to any of us. They have not contacted any of our representatives. They have not offered tribute or trade. They have not followed the correct routes that we have marked for those we have previously granted safe passage. They have not shown us the respect proper to those who are the law.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they appear to have valuables.\n\nMore than one horse laden with goods was observed, along with several unusual or rare curiosities, among them an American flag. These curiosities can be sold, and whatever they have used to purchase them can be distributed among us. Although at least one of them was clearly armed, such is not at all unusual in Yugra, and we know well how to engage outsiders within our territory.\n\nVehicles are already being prepared - both for the engaging party as well as for the spoils to be had. The only question that remains is how large a party to send."

Enlisting Zoya was, without a doubt, the best decision I have made so far in Russia, excepting my time spent in Omsk, of course, for it was she who spotted the sunlight reflecting off of one of their scopes.\n\nThough one of our horses was killed, her quick actions got both myself and others out of the initial line of fire and into a defilade. There I witnessed the sight of a master of their craft in action, as she shot down two of them from extreme range. Our other assailants quit the field soon after, clearly not having expected one of such skill among our number.\n\nWhen we investigated the bodies shortly after, Zoya mentioned that they bore the tattoos of men who had long spent time in prison. The 'thieves' of the Thief Territory. Having now killed several of them, and clearly not receiving a warm welcome besides, she recommended we pass through the region quickly, and I had no reason to disagree.\n\nWe now make for the northwest with all haste, and with luck, we will leave this place in the near future."

They resisted as strongly as they were able, but were killed soon after, their tactical position near-hopeless.\n\nApart from one of their number, a woman with a rifle identified by one brother as bearing the marks of a formerly-active anti-German partisan organization, and who killed two brothers, the intruders proved easy prey. After the fighting had ended, the party stripped the bodies and rolled them into a shallow grave before searching the baggage train and butchering the horses.\n\nUpon inspection, there were a number of items and curiosities of great interest to the brothers, including products from all across Siberia rarely seen anywhere near the Urals. In addition, it would seem that the American flag observed earlier - which was also recovered - belonged to one of the intruders who was, surprisingly, carrying an American passport.\n\nIncredibly, he was also carrying a diary recounting his travels across the vastness of Siberia and Russia proper, crossing the territory of many different states and meeting many different personalities.

Eight hours of intensive further observation, following distribution of my force over approximately one hundred (100) kilometers in either direction, revealed no attempts of the party to re-attempt further intrusion.\n\nAt this time, I cannot conclude as to the intentions or objectives of said party.

But today I turned around for the first time.\n\nAfter the ambush in the Thief Territory, we crossed quickly into the northern reaches of the Ural Mountains, summiting them in short order and inspecting the desolate lands beyond. And, as I looked towards them, I somehow felt a coldness not attributable to the weather. A certainty that I have not yet felt. A certainty that to proceed would be the end of me. Of all of us.\n\nThe ambush, and our narrow escape from it, taught me that I can no longer consider only myself. Zoya and the others accompanying me are trusting me with leadership, and I nearly led them to their deaths by not listening to the stories I had heard. None of them have said anything, but I know they have been thinking it. And so, when I turned to Zoya after looking over that cold land and shook my head I could tell, from her eyes alone, that I had made the right choice.\n\nWe are therefore returning south, moving towards [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk].

The American, who goes by "Steve," told Romanov that he was a tourist who was exploring Russia and presented proof to support his wild claim, including a genuine American passport and a ticket to Magadan.\n\nWhile some in the group appeared to seasoned veterans and may have posed a threat, Romanov deemed "Steve" to pose little risk to the District and escorted the group to [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk]."
 RUS_tourist.54.a: "An American? Well, it won't hurt to show him around."

 RUS_tourist.55.t: "Entry 21: [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk]"
 RUS_tourist.55.d: "Zoya had told me that [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] had broken away from the West Siberian Republic under the rule of Marshal Rokossovsky, the so-called "Lion of Siberia." While she knew little of their rule, she had heard that Rokossovsky governed with a much lighter hand compared to the Leninists in Tyumen. Considering their patrols haven't fired at us on sight, I'd say she heard correctly.\n\nAfter a short interrogation during which I recounted my tale of being a Yankee tourist and presented some documents prove it, I, along with the rest of the group, was escorted to [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] proper albeit under armed guard.\n\nWhile our group was under constant watch, life in [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] seemed quite tolerable. The soldiers were friendly, and the people seemed content under the rule of the Marshal. We were provided with adequate accommodations in a local barracks and treated to a passable meal. Not as good as what we were given in Omsk but a definite step up from eating canned food while freezing in the Urals.\n\nThe next morning, we were treated to a parade by a rifle division. It was quite a sight, rows upon rows of well-disciplined soldiers marching in near lockstep, punctuated by a 21 gun salute from an artillery battery. For sure, it's a damn sight better than what the Minnesota National Guard regularly shows off. I think Zoya and the others thought so too - she said that the last time she saw a parade like this was years ago, right before the Siberian War between the Far Eastern Soviet and the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nAfter spending a bit more time in the city and purchasing additional provisions, we said our goodbyes to [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk]. Our next destination is Zlatoust, who I've been told are arms dealers of some repute, Zoya says we shouldn't expect any trouble, and I am quite eager to see what a country run by gun-runners looks like."
 RUS_tourist.55.a: "Not bad, but Omsk was better."

 RUS_tourist.56.t: "An American, Westward Bound"
 RUS_tourist.56.d: "While it would be a lie to say that tensions between Zlatoust and [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] didn't exist, the borders are open for trade, travel, and tourism. The city of [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] proper is rather close to our own Novouralsk, which has become a hub for caravans, travelers, businesses, and refugees to set up along or travel on; as long as they pay, of course. Late last night, however, two people on foot were traveling to Novouralsk, with one carrying an American flag behind him. Marching stalwartly toward our border, it attracted curious looks from some of our guards, and chuckles from most of the others.\n\n"Hello there! My name is Steve! I would like to travel through the Zlatoust Republic to experience the unique situation it is in and the many attractions it offers to its citizens!" Most of the guards were smiling, and a few chuckles managed to escape them, yet they remained professional and composed.\n\n"Da, Americansky. But you two must, er, how do you say... pay toll." Perhaps the news would be more bearable to Steve in English. No matter who the traveler is, no matter how noble their goals, no matter how interesting they are, we simply cannot uphold our quality of life without money. This strange and seemingly daring tourist was no exception.\n\n"I do not think we have the Zlatoust currency..." The young man seemed to embarrassingly stumble on his English, yet his companion, a hardened and clearly Russian woman traveling alongside him, offered the border guards some of the currency, barter goods, and a basic sweet talk to get the pair rolling along. While it certainly wasn't anywhere close to what our guards usually charge, they don't seem to harbor any malicious intent and they were allowed to past shortly after, seeking to get on a bus to the city of Zlatoust itself."

Apparently, after I started a bar fight among SOLDIERS in one of the most prestigious bars in Zlatoust, I made a dumb drunken advance on Mikhail Kalishnakov's daughter, Nelli.\n\nI threw up right after. Zoya practically had to intimidate the entire bar just to carry my now passed out ass out of there, and she drove us toward the border with the Ural League.

 RUS_tourist.58.t: "Strangers Out of the Cold"
 RUS_tourist.58.d: "The Guards stared at the gawky man and his female guide, not entirely sure what to make of them. The pair were bundled in thick winter coats, the hard-faced woman carrying a scoped rifle, the glasses of the man fogged beyond sight. "We seek entry to your lands," said the woman in clipped Russian. "My name is Zoya and this man is Steve." Upon hearing his name, the man waved at the Guards, who then exchanged looks.\n\nThe Guards eyed the strange pair warrily, sure the man posed no threat but the woman radiated deadly poise. Finally, one of the Guards spoke up, "are you refugees? We have plenty of warm food and-"\n\n"No," said the woman, "we're not refugees." A look of confusion passed between the sentinels and the second Guard replied.\n\n"Then what are you? Are you looking for employment? Mercenaries?"\n\nThe woman, Zoya, smiled, her lips twisting her wind-burnt face, "We're not refugees or mercenaries, comrades, we're tourists."\n\nThe Guards didn't know what to make of this, but waved the pair to follow them back towards Sibay. Tourists? Who the hell would be crazy enough to tour the Southern Urals?"
 RUS_tourist.58.a: "Wait until Starinov hears about this!"

 RUS_tourist.59.t: "Entry 22: Snug in a Bunker"
 RUS_tourist.59.d: "When I went behind the walls of Sibay, the last thing I expected out of this bunker-city was coziness. I'm pleased to report that my quarters are clean and comfortable and they even have heating! I was told by Russians in other communities that the Southern Urals were a hellhole, but honestly, I can't see it. Everyone is so friendly, the food is good, and some of the Guards even know some English! Even Zoya is loosening up a little. She's been spending a lot of time with this Zaitsev guy, I think he used to be a sniper too. I've managed to find myself a friend too, his name is Pavel. Good guy, around my age, smokes a pack a day and has a surprisingly soft singing voice in spite of it.\n\nMe and him were talking the other night about the Southern Urals and I got to asking him why it had such a bad reputation. "Steve," he said to me in his broken, thickly accented English, "Ural League keeps people safe behind walls and with guns. Outside walls, there is cold, many bandit." I asked him how the other communities in the Urals managed and if he would recommend where I should go next and he said, "no place, get out of Ural. Orsk is bandit country run by King Rapist. Magnitogorsk even worse, crazy scientist in charge there, no one ever leave. Orenburg full of stupid, waste of time." I guess if the other territories are as bad as Pavel says, no wonder Sibay is a bunker-city! I should ask Zoya about it, she seems to know a little bit about everything."
 RUS_tourist.59.a: "Is his name actually King Rapist?"

 RUS_tourist.60.t: "Fascist Minion at the Gates!"
 RUS_tourist.60.d: "The Communes are in a tizzy today as reports of an American and what is likely an ROA stooge entering our borders have reached the council. We cannot stand idly by and allow a fascist toady to sully our free socialist soil! Thus, the council was convened to determine a solution to deal with this insidious invader. After twenty-six hours of debate and an impassioned fist-fight, an agreement was reached. The council has concluded that using force to apprehend the fascist American spy and his Hitlerite goon would itself be a fascist action. Was not our commune founded on the principles of self-determination? We may hate him, but it is his right to be a fascist puppet of the American Reich and we cannot infringe upon it. If we imprison or attack this man for being a Nazi scoundrel, are we not also fascists?"
 RUS_tourist.60.a: "At least our morals remain pure."
 
 RUS_tourist.61.t: "Entry 23: Like a Car Crash by Committee"
 RUS_tourist.61.d: "I've heard the term 'anarchy' thrown around a lot in Orenburg. I think what the meant was 'total clusterfuck'. I was invited to a council meeting so that I, as an American Nazi-Tsarist-Bandit, might be 'enlightened by anarchism in action'. I don't really know what this was meant to accomplish because I've never seen anything so messy and dysfunctional! I know we Americans joke about the convoluted heap that is the NPP and Republican-Democratic Party, but our politics have nothing on Orenburg.\n\nThe meeting started out with the speaker, some little guy with glasses, being shouted down by half of the room, who I guess didn't like him very much. My Russian isn't great, but it isn't hard to figure out what 'fashisty' means. I have no idea what the meeting was even supposed to be about, and I'm pretty sure the council didn't either. At some point, fully three different speakers attempted to hold their speeches over one another, shouting louder and louder to be heard. I tried to say something to Zoya a couple times, but she never heard me over the noise. I won't even get started on the brawl that started in the middle of the room or the shoe that almost beaned me right in the head.\n\nWhen I was a little kid, my teacher used a talking stick to make sure only one person was speaking at a time so we wouldn't shout over each other. I'm sure Orenburg could really benefit from something like that, but I bet they would just decry a talking stick as an 'instrument of Hitlerite oppression'. Orenburg kind of sucks and I'm looking forward to getting the hell out of here."

 RUS_tourist.62.t: "Hello Mother, Hello Father"
 RUS_tourist.62.d: "Hi, mom and dad! I'm writing to you from Siberia just to tell you that I'm okay and not to worry. The Urals and Western Siberia have been quite the adventure. The sheer number of warlords out here is crazy, and in Western Siberia alone you can find every ideology under the sun. Nazis, commies, anarchists, and even liberals are out here, each with their own vision of how to save the Russian people. It's crazy to think that just thirty years ago (or so) this used to be one big country. For all the desolation and the ruins, there's a kind of beauty here that I didn't expect. I remember waking up one morning in Sibay and watching the rising sun stretch over the Urals. Never in my life have I wished I was an artist more. I wish you could see what I'm seeing, the good parts, I mean.\n\nI'm eating well, and my guide, Zoya, is keeping me safe. She used to be a partisan sniper back in the day so I'm never too worried when she's around. I think cousin Henry might like her, you know how he has a thing for strong ladies. She's been teaching me Russian and I think I'm really getting the hang of it. I have lots of questions for the locals and it feels awkward having Zoya do most of the translating, so I'm glad how well my lessons are going.\n\nHow are the neighbors? Did grandma's cough pass? Who won the Little League championship this year? Miss you, and I'll write again as soon as I can!\n\nP.S. I had to trade an automatic rifle to a smuggler to get this letter to you, so it's worth one AK-47. It's a bit more than a stamp, that's for sure."
 RUS_tourist.62.a: "Love, your son, Steve."

 RUS_tourist.63.t: "An Arrival from Orenburg"
 RUS_tourist.63.d: "A strange party recently entered the Republic's lands from the territory administered by Orenburg. The party, consisting of several Russians and an extensive baggage train was, remarkably, led by an American, and requested passage to Ufa.\n\nAlthough our frontier detachments were initially suspicious of their motives, prolonged questioning of the party, as well as close examination of their belongings, convinced them of the party's lack of hostile intent. Indeed, this American appears to be travelling across Russia, visiting as many states as possible and compiling a log of them, and this fact has not gone unnoticed by several members of our government.\n\nThey have raised the fact that international recognition of the Republic was and is critical to the maintenance of our sovereignty in the face of numerous regional and other threats. Therefore, increasing awareness of our Republic, our culture, and our challenges within America, and thus by extension the OFN, cannot but be beneficial.\n\nIt has been suggested that we chaperone the tourist and his entourage around Ufa, expose him to our cultural and religious practices, and allow him to see the regular devastation wrought by the German bombers. Surely if we do so he cannot but speak of the plight of our Republic, standing strong for our people in a time of great danger. And against great threats, besides.\n\nIf it will draw any attention at all, it will be worth it. We must only decide how insistent to be."
 RUS_tourist.63.a: "Strongly. We must not waste this opportunity."
 RUS_tourist.63.b: "Less strongly. We must not appear demanding."

 RUS_tourist.64.t: "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.64.d: "Russia has been, for me and so far, a land of firsts. And Bashkiria, an officially Islamic state created by and for the Bashkir minority, is certainly that.\n\nCrossing from, and thankfully leaving behind, the chaos of Orenburg, we were allowed over the border with only several hours interrogation - very quickly by our standards so far. What's more, soon after we were approached by a small governmental delegation that offered to show us around. Zoya was wary about any 'minders,' but I saw an opportunity to gain access to experiences we might not have otherwise, in fear of offense. And that opportunity soon paid off.\n\nThe representative invited us to attend a service at Ufa's central mosque, as long as we were properly quiet and respectful, and though I have been a Christian all my life I must say it was most beautiful. The muezzin's call radiating from the mosque's minaret was oddly soothing, and the practiced ritual within, though far different from any church I have been in, possessed a serenity and sense of religious unity that I do not think I can accurately describe.\n\nLater, we toured the market where Zoya explained to me, as best she could, about the persecution these Bashkirs have traditionally faced. About how this state was their attempt to carve out a true homeland for themselves amid a war between parties that both despised them.\n\nBut, alas, it is time to move on, and so in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."
 RUS_tourist.64.a: "A homeland for one's people is a noble goal indeed."

 RUS_tourist.65.t: "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.65.d: "Over the last short while, I have grown to respect the Bashkir people tremendously. And I do not say such lightly.\n\nSo many of the states we have passed through have existed for no other reason than because some tyrant wanted them to. Because that tyrant wanted to control the lives of thousands or millions absolutely, and woe to those who crossed them. But here there is a national identity. A national culture. A national religion. All things that the Bashkirs fight for despite nearly everyone trying to take them away.\n\nToday, as we were touring the city's downtown, attending the Turkic monuments that still stood, we saw evidence of that. One of the ever-present German bombing raids shattered some buildings in Ufa, and we were nearby. Immediately we saw people, not just soldiers and police, but ordinary people from all places and classes rush forward to assist those trapped under the rubble. And, being close by, we could not but do the same ourselves.\n\nAs we helped, I could feel the spirit of community around me, a spirit, and feeling, that has been in very short supply in many of the places we have been so far. When I return home I hope that my journey to Bashkiria, together with what I have seen and felt while here, inspires others to keep this tiny nation in their thoughts and minds. It would be well-deserved by these people.\n\nBut, alas, our time here has necessarily come to an end, and in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."
 RUS_tourist.65.a: "A homeland for one's people is a noble goal indeed."

 RUS_tourist.66.t: "An Aryan Arrival?"
 RUS_tourist.66.d: "Our brothers watching over the Belaya for any intrusion by the filthy Bashkirs have reported to their commanders in Permhaym of a very strange encounter.\n\nA party, flying an American flag, recently crossed the river and was composed not of Bashkirs, but of Slavs led by a man they believed potentially Aryan. When the brothers moved to arrest him, he showed recognition of their uniforms, and began speaking German. They are therefore not sure what to make of the party.\n\nThe man claims to be American, journeying across Russia to observe the states and societies that occupy it, and though we know well how much corrupting subhuman influence exists in America, we cannot deny the basic possibility for Aryanism to exist there. If we were to welcome him, and showcase the superiority of our culture and race, of our purpose to bring strength and purity to the entire nation, it could do much for the Fyurer's cause.\n\nAt the same time, however, there is a party of Slavs with him, who in addition to possessing weapons do not seem as subservient as non-Aryans should be. He has additionally displayed some unease at the sight of the border guards' slave detachment. Some brothers have raised the concern that the entire construction of this 'American' could therefore be a trick, an attempt to insert a spy in our lands.\n\nA decision must be made. What do we do with this supposed 'Aryan?'"
 RUS_tourist.66.a: "An Aryan from abroad? We must receive him!"
 RUS_tourist.66.b: "Look closer. The trickery of the Slav knows no bounds."

 RUS_tourist.67.t: "Entry 25: The Aryan Brotherhood"
 RUS_tourist.67.d: "The so-called Brotherhood is nothing like what I had imagined. It is worse. It is so much worse, that in truth I have trouble finding the words to properly describe my horror.\n\nCrossing the Belaya from Ufa, we were nearly immediately set upon by brutish soldiers in German-looking uniforms, but once I began speaking to them in that language their demeanour shifted entirely, and a short while later we found ourselves escorted to their capital in Perm, or Permhaym as they call it. It was there that I discovered the monstrosity of a state we have found ourselves in.\n\nThe city is a nightmare, with vast processions of slaves shifted between worksites for forced labor. The slightest hesitation or defiance is met with brutal violence or summary execution, the choice of which seems to depend entirely on the whims of the specific oppressor. The 'brothers' call them subhumans and both themselves, and me, Aryan, which I have realized is the only reason we have not joined the unfortunates before us.\n\nIndeed, it has taken all my efforts to keep Zoya and the others together and under my supervision, and I do not know if I can do so much longer. I feel sick every time I speak to one of these monsters, and I fear it will not be long before they discover my true feelings.\n\nI have therefore spoken to Zoya, and she agrees that we must act before we are separated or our hosts change their opinion of me. Tonight we will wait for darkness and then make for the Kama, on the other side of which rests safety.\n\nI only hope we will make it. We should not have come."
 RUS_tourist.67.a: "Utterly horrifying."

 RUS_tourist.68.t: "No True Aryan"
 RUS_tourist.68.d: "Our prudence in receiving this new arrival was well-placed. For he was no true Aryan.\n\nAlthough he recognized the superiority of our equipment design, although he spoke German, although his honeyed words claimed friendship and discovery, his actions proved otherwise. And our brothers were vigilant enough to observe them. Vigilant enough to protect the purity of spirit, purity of form, and purity of essence that the Aryan embodies. Purity that this arrival clearly did not possess.\n\nFor what true Aryan would travel willingly with armed Slavs without careful overwatch? What true Aryan would treat them as his equals? What true Aryan would concern themselves with the 'plight' of the subhumans? No true Aryan, indeed.\n\nAnd so both he and they were therefore treated as any other suspect non-Aryans. Disarmed, placed in chains, and marched towards Permhaym. All except one - a Slav woman who attempted resistance, and found what was left of her dumped in the forest in response.\n\nThe brothers overseeing the factories around our capital have been informed of the imminent arrivals, and will soon find places where they can work to support their betters. In so doing, they can serve the purpose deserved to them.\n\nAnd if they show themselves unwilling to do so, well, the brothers are most skilled at applying proper discipline."
 RUS_tourist.68.a: "The Slav within will always make themselves known."

 RUS_tourist.69.t: "A Riverine Skirmish"
 RUS_tourist.69.d: "Earlier today, a skirmish near the Kama river was reported. Elements of the Imperial Army, stationed nearby to keep watch on the territory of the fanatics in Perm, reported seeing a small party fleeing Brotherhood militias and attempting to cross the river.\n\nUpon observing that one of the party was carrying a large American flag, and additionally understanding the brutality of those living within Brotherhood territory, they moved to engage. As Brotherhood fighters began firing upon the party, itself struggling to cross the river, our forces engaged them, killing or wounding several before the fighters retreated.\n\nUpon rescue and interrogation, the leader of the party provided evidence identifying himself as an American and requested entry for himself and his companions into the Principality. He further explained that he was travelling across Russia on a journey of exploration, and that he was most grateful for their rescue from Brotherhood forces.\n\nFollowing confirmation that none of the American's companions were wanted by the Tsar's government, they were permitted entry and proceeded in the direction of Izhvesk.\n\nSecurity forces will maintain surveillance until their departure."
 RUS_tourist.69.a: "An American, here? From the East?"

 RUS_tourist.70.t: "Entry 26: The Principality of Vyatka"
 RUS_tourist.70.d: "Thank God for those soldiers saving us as we crossed the river from those psychopaths in Perm. I never want to go back there ever again. I also hope someone stamps them out for good. Zoya agrees.\n\nThis new nation we find ourselves in, Vyatka, seems much more stable than the last few. It's apparently ruled by a Tsar, who I thought was dead. At least that's what Mikhail told me, all the way back in Chita. Perhaps they're related? In any case we're here now, and not surrounded by black-clad murderers or literal slaves, so I'll give thanks regardless.\n\nWe've headed south, to the city of Izhvesk, which Zoya says she passed through years ago on her journey eastwards. It's certainly one of the more developed cities we've seen so far, with enormous industrial plants and factories producing equipment of all kinds. Even so, there seems to be a general malaise, as if everything has faded slightly. I'm not exactly sure how to properly describe it.\n\nThe one thing I have taken from this city, however, is a replacement for our horses now that we're in a part of Russia that actually has an extensive road network, as damaged as it may be. Using some of my remaining funds, I have purchased a reasonably new truck, which we shall use as we continue south-east, towards Tatarstan.\n\nIt should help accelerate this final leg of our journey considerably, and provide a better means of escape should we encounter future problems."
 RUS_tourist.70.a: "A faded city. But safety, nonetheless."

 RUS_tourist.71.t: "Entrants from Vyatka"
 RUS_tourist.71.d: "A group has entered the Republic from Vyatka, crossing the river of the same name earlier this afternoon and presenting their travel documents. Consisting primarily of Russians, the one extraordinary exception is that of an American claiming to be on a journey across the whole of Russia, and this claim is supported by a dizzying array of artifacts originating from as far east as Petropavlovsk.\n\nAfter so proving their identity, they were allowed to proceed and departed, travelling in the direction of Kazan by way of Arsk in a Vyatkan-built truck. A truck that was observed to be flying a large American flag from its exhaust stack, and thus drawing the attention of many nearby.\n\nWe do not quite know what to make of this event. The party and its composition, especially the American with evidence of travel, is far too ostentatious and elaborate to be a reasonable attempt at cover from infiltrators from nearby states. However, when regarding the Tatar people, 'reasonable' has not historically been a word that can be applied to the Russians. We must be careful.\n\nThe party will not be harmed, lest there be an attempt being made to provoke the displeasure of the Americans or, by extension, the OFN. It will be allowed to proceed and interact, assuming the members of it do not attempt to break our laws.\n\nBut it will be watched. Carefully. The security of our people demands constant vigilance, even in situations where it may appear absurd."
 RUS_tourist.71.a: "One must always remain attentive."
 
 RUS_tourist.72.t: "Entry 27: The Republic of Tatarstan"
 RUS_tourist.72.d: "Entering Tatarstan, another state founded on the basis of the identity of an ethnic minority, I think I could be forgiven for assuming it would be similar to neighboring Bashkiria. How wrong I was.\n\nThough they were not instantly hostile, the border guards looked long and hard at Zoya and the other Russians, and only seemed to relax - and display genuine interest besides - when they realized I was American, something I have grown to half-expect. As we began the journey to Kazan through the region's dense forests, this interest was displayed by nearly all that we passed, encouraged no doubt by my flag, which we have now attached to the exhaust stack and which waves proudly in the wind wherever we drive.\n\nExpecting to arrive at the city quite late, we together worried about finding accommodations, but this turned out not to be an issue, for as the city came into sight we were greeted with a sight both inspiring and terrifying. A German bomber raid had arrived over the city, and Kazan's air defense network, which Zoya had earlier told me was among the densest in Russia, and captured by the Tatars nearly wholescale when they seized the city, sprang into action.\n\nI cannot adequately describe the noises or colours that faced us over the next while, except as a thunderous kaleidoscope, with booming reds, reverberating yellows, and meteoric greens rising into the sky at small objects far overhead.\n\nBy the time the raid ended darkness had fallen, and so we decided to find an area to make camp, rather than risk entering a city on alert in the dead of night. In the morning, we will visit the city and then continue onwards to our next destination, heading south towards Samara. Even so, I do not think I will soon forget this experience.\n\nIndeed, I expect I will see it in my dreams."
 RUS_tourist.72.a: "A thunderous kaleidoscope."

 RUS_tourist.73.t: "In the Land of Treason"
 RUS_tourist.73.d: "As the Committee's border guards watched the truck approach that morning, they were not sure what to make of it. A Vyatkan truck, flying an American flag proudly from its exhaust stack, approaching from Tatarstan? Absurd, indeed.\n\nThey were only more confused when the window rolled down to reveal, among the Russians inside, an American. And their confusion reached its height when, in response to their interrogation, he told them he was travelling across the country. Inspecting his cargo and documents, which bore stamps from places as far away as Chita, Krasnoyarsk, and [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk], they could not but believe him. And once a solicited bribe was paid, the way opened quickly.\n\nThe unpleasant experience at the border, however, foreshadowed nearly every subsequent encounter. Soldiers stared at them with suspicion and, often, barely-contained greed. People avoided them, having long learned that to involve oneself with the unusual was to court disaster. The American's companion, herself a former fighter against the Germans, seethed with, when out of sight of any soldiers, barely-contained rage.\n\nThe 'Vlasovites' were traitors, animals, little more than dogs, she said. There was no discovery to be had here, only hostility and depressing visages. Though she was usually content to allow the American to direct their course, here she offered advice - divert, and leave this blighted 'country' far behind.\n\nThe American pondered. He had long grown to trust the opinions and instincts of his compatriot, and yet the entire reason he had come to Russia was to observe the states and societies that comprised it.\n\nDid he divert course? Or did he tell her they were continuing?"
 RUS_tourist.73.a: "They continue on, towards Stavropol-na-Volga."

 RUS_tourist.74.d: "Zoya warned me that the lands of the 'Vlasovites' were likely to be a depressing and hostile place, and I am sad to say she was right.\n\nThe atmosphere was immediately evident as soon as we crossed the border, south of Kazan. The soldiers, some of them wearing German-dervied equipment, were uniformly surly and unpleasant, and many of those encountered all but demanded bribes for passage. Not wanting them to investigate ourselves - and especially Zoya - any closer, we complied.\n\nThe lands and people we passed while heading southwards were as the sky itself was - gray, dreary, and decrepit, as if the life had been sucked out of them. The first major city we reached after passing through Simbirsk, Stavropol-na-Volga was, if it could be considered possible, even worse.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk grasped by some unseen malaise, but Stavropol seemed a city permanently braced for misery. The people looked at us with fear, and the demands for bribes only increased. Resources were scarce, with nearly everything appropriated by the military, and I was told that families hide their sons in attempts to avoid conscription. Indeed, it was so depressing that all I can remember, even now, is gray. Gray skies, gray roads, gray buildings, and gray food.\n\nZoya and the others expressed similar opinions, and so after a brief discussion, we decided to cut short our time in this horrible land. We will be making the next turn northwest, towards Gorky, reportedly the territory of an ex-Soviet tank brigade that has taken to raiding the German territories to the west for supplies.\n\nI confess to being slightly wary at the prospect, after our experiences in the Thief Territory, but these thoughts are tempered by the certainty that those lands must at least be better than the ones here."

The soldiers, some of them wearing German-dervied equipment, were uniformly surly and unpleasant, and many of those encountered all but demanded bribes for passage. Not wanting them to investigate ourselves - and especially Zoya - any closer, we complied.\n\nIt was after the third such checkpoint that I made the decision. Zoya had been right. This land was depressing and hostile, and I found myself remembering the pledge I had made far to the north, outside Vorkuta. Pressing ahead did nothing but put us all in danger for the certainty of little reward. And that I will no longer accept.\n\nWe are instead diverting directly westwards, towards Gorky, reportedly the territory of an ex-Soviet tank brigade that has taken to raiding the German territories to the west for supplies. I confess to being slightly wary at the prospect, after our experiences in the Thief Territory, but these thoughts are tempered by the certainty that those lands must at least be better than the ones here.\n\nIn further attempts to avoid unwanted attention, we are progressing through more rural areas, and remaining off of the major roads. I suspect that Zoya may be using passages and shortcuts familiar to her from many years past, but I know better than to ask.\n\nIf she wants to tell me, she will. Otherwise I will leave us in her capable hands."
 RUS_tourist.75.a: "What a thoroughly depressing place."

 RUS_tourist.76.t: "Unauthorized Entry"
 RUS_tourist.76.d: "One of our light-armored detachments south of Kstovo has reported the unauthorized crossing of the Brigade-Committee border by a single truck, itself apparently of Vyatkan origin.\n\nAlthough the traitors in Samara have attempted incursions into our territory before, it has never been in such a fashion. In addition, the unit's commander has reported that the truck is prominently flying an American flag. Before committing the Brigade's forces to action, he has petitioned command for instructions. Central Staff is unsure of how to proceed.\n\nLaunching a full counterattack, in anticipation of the truck acting as a scout for a Committee-led raid, would consume considerable quantities of fuel, likely requiring an additional raid of the Reich's holdings to the west to replenish. However, sending a small party to meet the truck could leave said party vulnerable to ambush or capture. If we were to do so, the commander appointed would be critical, as they would have to act immediately based on the information at hand and their own personality.\n\nEither way, however, we must respond, and quickly. What command should be given?"
 RUS_tourist.76.a: "A small party, but appoint an aggressive commander."
 RUS_tourist.76.b: "A small party, but appoint a more diplomatic commander."

 RUS_tourist.77.t: "Entry 27: The Gorky Tank Brigade"
 RUS_tourist.77.d: "Following Zoya's advice, which I have grown to respect and trust tremendously over our long journey together, our party turned northwest from Stavropol-na-Volga and proceeded towards the territory of the so-called Gorky Tank Brigade.\n\nAlthough, as previously written, I was wary after hearing of their reputation as raiders, after explaining ourselves to the small party of tanks and armored vehicles that intercepted us after crossing the border we were permitted to proceed towards Gorky itself. And what a sight it was.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk a grand example of industrial activity in Western Russia, but Gorky puts it to shame, with enormous factories turning out tank after tank, armoured car after armoured car. And unlike the ones we have seen otherwise on our travels, the Brigade actually decorates them with more than just a sigil.\n\nPassing through the city square, we saw a company of tanks pass through in formation, each painted iridescently in the image of a type of panther. The unit was, unsurprisingly, referred to as the 'Panther' company. I preferred the look of the lion 'model,' but Zoya preferred the look of the snow leopard, I assume from her previous time spent travelling across southern Siberia.\n\nAfter a short stay, during which I saw several members of the Brigade look longingly at our truck, we decided to again move on, this time heading north over the Volga towards Vologdan territory. Everyone says they are 'neutral,' and I am very curious to see what that word actually means in the chaos that is Russia."
 RUS_tourist.77.a: "Perhaps I should learn to paint?"

 RUS_tourist.78.t: "The 'American'"
 RUS_tourist.78.d: "Our light-armoured unit south of Kstrovo has reported further developments surrounding the solitary truck earlier reported entering the Brigade's territory from that of the Committee.\n\nOrdering a small detachment to intercept it, upon doing so those occupying the truck proved hesitant to immediately abandon it when commanded to do so. The unit's commander, recently returned from a western raid, was apparently so stunned by this hesitation that he immediately ordered the parties within to be forcibly extracted and immediately shot.\n\nThis order was subsequently carried out, despite attempted resistance, and the bodies of the occupants were cremated soon after.\n\nFurthermore, the commander, taking note of a design quirk of the Vyatkan truck, had it moved to a local workshop where it was modified with armor plating, several light cannon off of disused armored vehicles, and significantly wider tires. He then personally drove it back to Gorky, with the American flag still flying from its exhaust stack.\n\nAlthough crude, the value of the vehicle was immediately seen. Armoured sufficiently to resist small arms fire from German settlers, but with sufficiently strong armament to defeat the same, along with significantly better fuel economy, carrying capacity, and navigatory ability, it is expected to perform well on raids into German territory.\n\nWhile the identity of the parties occupying it were not ascertained, the presence of the flag on the truck has led to the vehicle itself colloquially becoming known as 'an American.'\n\nConsequent demand has led to the retooling of a production line in Gorky in order to convert civilian trucks into 'Americans' for future use by the Brigade."
 RUS_tourist.78.a: "Thanks for the idea, whoever you were."

 RUS_tourist.79.t: "A Neutral Curiosity"
 RUS_tourist.79.d: "When the truck first arrived on the bridge over the Volga, the Vologdan border guards were unsure of what to make of it. A Vyatkan truck, proudly flying an American flag, and carrying an actual American applied for entry to the Neutral State at a place of entry that rarely, if ever, saw either. Let alone both together.\n\nBereft of reason to deny entry, however, the guards eventually allowed passage, after considerable interrogation, of course. As the truck crossed the river and turned onto the main roadway towards Vologda proper, its passengers were most perplexed.\n\nThey had been to so many places where the people were fearful of outsiders, careful to hide themselves away until safety was assured. But here it was very different. Here people peered at and waved to the truck as it passed by, curious about and interested in both the flag and the people who drove under it. And, on one of the vanishingly few occasions to do so that had been made apparent so far, the passengers waved back.\n\nIndeed, as they drew closer they got to the city, and as the habitation became more dense, so too did the amount and degree of attention increase, to the great delight of one of the passengers. By the time the truck reached Vologda, the group riding in it were thoroughly energized, ready to explore a state that had so apparently warmly accepted them.\n\nSuch was quite a rarity in Russia indeed, and the passengers intended to make the most of it."
 RUS_tourist.79.a: "Neutrality has its benefits."

 RUS_tourist.80.t: "Entry 30: The Neutral State of Vologda"
 RUS_tourist.80.d: "Having now reached the city proper, I can confidently say that Vologda is a most serene place.\n\nThe people are committed to stability, both internal and without, and unlike in so many other places, and as I have written before, the soldiers and police appear to act to protect the people and prevent violence. While this should be the natural order of things, it is, as I am distressed to have personally experienced, quite an oddity in Russia. Truly an enviable city, indeed.\n\nIt is, however, no Omsk. While the people here are certainly peaceful, and committed to their ideals of armed neutrality, they do not have the drive, the passion, the total commitment to that peace that I observed in that great city. There I remember being struck by the wild-eyed passion for peace, for the drive towards the final victory of it, and for the absolute certainty possessed by so many, especially the officials, that they would achieve such, They knew that there would be challenges, or 'Trials' as they had seemingly taken to calling them, but they were not afraid, and some even looked forward to them.\n\nNo, Vologda is no Omsk, but it is close as I think I have yet found, and that must be enough. Regardless, we must move on. Zoya is directing us northeast, towards an apparently fractious democratic republic, and I am cautiously optimistic that it may display some of the fundamentally beneficial and stabilizing qualities we have seen in the depressingly few democracies we have so far encountered.\n\nIf not, I am sure it will at least be interesting to observe."
 RUS_tourist.80.a: "The Omsk of the West?"

 RUS_tourist.81.t: "From One Democracy to Another"
 RUS_tourist.81.d: "The border with Vologda had always been a quiet and uneventful place, quite the rarity in Western Russia. For many soldiers it was the perfect station; no raids, few smugglers, just a place where you could sit back and not have to constantly worry about getting shot. It was much better than Syktyvkar at the very least. But every now and then, oddities would crop up from the Neutral State.\n\nOne such oddity arrived early that morning in Veliky Ustyug, when a truck bearing an American flag pulled up at a local checkpoint. When questioned, the driver was discovered to be an American himself, having come a long way from the east all the way here to Komi on a tour through Russia.\n\nPerplexed, the guards immediately began debating with each other on what to do. Their own political biases quickly arose, with accusations being thrown around of him being a CIA agent, or a hired spy from Moskowien, or even an infiltrator from the Revolutionary Front, as absurd as it sounded. It was rare to see such a foreign face, and with political divisions at an all time high in the republic, so were suspicions. Ultimately though, it was up to their commander.\n\nAfter some deliberation, the guards were ordered to let the truck pass. Reluctantly they waved the American and his entourage through the checkpoint, and into the most unstable democracy in Russia. They made their way towards Syktyvkar, and when they arrived would visit..."

 RUS_tourist.81.c: "...Internatsionalskaya Street."
 
 RUS_tourist.82.t: "Entry 31: The Assembly"
 RUS_tourist.82.d: "It seems like I arrived at quite an interesting time in Syktyvkar, and Komi as a whole. Entering the city, I quickly heard news about a session of the 'National Assembly', a government body not too dissimilar to Congress, occurring later that day. This, of course, was something I simply couldn't miss.\n\nIn short, it was chaotic. And yet it wasn't the anarchic mess that was Orenburg's council meeting; there was an order to it, in a weird way. The moment the president finished his opening speech, everyone was out shouting for their own agenda; and lord, were there a lot of agendas. I'll be frank when I say this; Komi is probably the most politically diverse nation I have ever seen in my life. Deputies of all stripes and beliefs debated long through the hours. Communists, monarchists, socialists and conservatives and liberals and so many others struggled to force their agenda through a myriad of bills and proposals and amendments.\n\nIn a strange way, it was... exhilarating? I never thought I'd be so invested into a bunch of old men and women bickering over tax rates, but there I was. It was like a movie, and the cast was the most colorful I've seen; there was a Ms. Stalina standing firm against the extremists, there was Mr. Gumilyov and Zhdanov, both boisterous and jovial, Mr. Taboritsky, who reminded me way too much of my Uncle Elmer, the creep, then there was the president and vice president. They both looked absolutely miserable.\n\nAnother figure of note wasn't actually in the assembly chamber, they were sitting right next to me in the gallery. Even at the most heated points in the assembly debate, this man never jeered or shouted or, well, showed much emotion at all, really. At the end of the session, he offered a handshake and we exchanged names. Something Suslov, I think he was. Nice fellow, but quite odd.\n\nKomi was a bizarre yet fascinating place. In a strange way, I wish I could've stayed a little while longer. But my journey continues north."
 RUS_tourist.82.a: "Home is where the heart is."

 RUS_tourist.83.t: "Entry 31: Syktyvkar & the Kuratov District"
 RUS_tourist.83.d: "Komi is best described as a "Place for Everyone". Even the criminals, it seems.\n\nThe Kuratov District of Syktyvkar is essentially a huge racket. Many of the locals here resort to radical leftism amidst the "failures of the Voronetsky government" as they say. Regular Luftwaffe bombings destroy morale, infastructure, and livelihoods, and it seems sometimes to the people of Komi that this radicalism will solve their problems. Among these problems, crime is a bit too high around these parts. As Zoya and I walked into the district, we were immediately almost pickpocketed by a group of children. A small gunfight between fascist partisans and communists barely drove them away. Zoya dragged me into an alleyway, where we stayed for a few minutes until the action died down. Of course, like sharks to blood, it seems desperate schemers can claw their way into "helping" the desperate.\n\nWhen I was trying to interview the average citizens of Syktyvkar, a socialist paramilitary group walked into the apartment building. Of course, seeing outsiders, they were more than happy to accost us.\n\n"Hey, look at this poor Yankee!" Some of them yelled. "You look like you've had a rough time in the Kuratov District, Tovarish. Why not pay us for some protection?"\n\nZoya was very apprehensive as was I, yet we had no chance to defend ourselves against armed and opportunistic partisans. After we failed to talk our way out of this situation, we were essentially forced to pay up as they "escorted" us around the district. As such, it was rather hard to interview non-socialists as we had guns and knives to our back, encouraging us to talk to more... favorable citizens. Nevertheless, they left us at the end of the day, and we quickly fled the District."
 RUS_tourist.83.a: "A way of life around here, I suppose."

 RUS_tourist.84.t: "Entry 31: Radio Free Syktyvkar"
 RUS_tourist.84.d: "Komi is best described as a "Place for Everyone", but I truly did not realize it until I ran into a certain someone on Internatsionalskaya Street. While looking for a place to spend the night, I ran into a radio host of Radio Free Syktyvkar, a man called Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov. Zoya and I have heard his voice and other broadcasts from RFS throughout our trek through Western Russia. Ivan was a short and stout but lively middle-aged man. We bumped into each other by accident while he was out shopping for vodka, of which I caught a falling bottle of his. While that in itself was an icebreaker, I told him a bit about my story and mission, of which Ivan excitedly invited me to star with him live on the air the following night. Zoya and I graciously accepted.\n\nAlthough the studio was small and certainly dated, Ivan's liveliness and the chemistry that we had together on the air was something I will always be able to visualize. It started off simple enough; a basic introduction, followed by my backstory, and finally how I came to Russia. Zoya decided to stay out of it, but she sat in the room with us to translate. After reading and discussing some diary entries for what felt like hours, we ended the show at the crack of dawn. Ivan wished us well, and I promised to write back to him when I return home. He was kind enough to leave an excerpt from the show, of which I will copy here.\n\n"So, Steve Smith. The legendary American from across the sea... Do you have anything to say to Komi? To Russia?"\n\n"Well, Ivan, truth be told, nothing can tell my story better than the heart can. Every word in this diary right here has come from it, and the stories of the wonderful people of Russia will never be forgotten. Despite the Union no longer existing, Russia is certainly far from lost, and the spirit of her people will never be erased. I promise that her stories will live on in this book. Especially this story.""
 RUS_tourist.84.a: ""I never fancied myself as a Radio co-host until now, Ivan!""

 RUS_tourist.85.t: "A Lone Vehicle"
 RUS_tourist.85.d: "The border between the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the Komi Republic was fairly militarized, considering the hostilities between the two factions in the past. Red Army soldiers patrolled its length, ensuring that no raiding occurred along the border, and that the situation between the two nations remained stable.\n\nAs such, it came as a mild shock to some Red Army soldiers to see a solitary civilian vehicle crossing the Kotlas Bridge, intent on crossing the border.\n\n"Outpost KB, this is Commander Dezhnyov. Reporting one civilian truck approaching the border, currently crossing the Kotlas Bridge. Multiple occupants, over," reported the unit's commander, as the rest of his troops entered defensive positions in case the situation escalated.\n\nBefore Dezhnyov could get a response, one of his soldiers asked, "Commander, does that look like the Komi flag to you?" Curious, Dezhnyov grabbed his binoculars and took a closer look. The flag the truck carried certainly wasn't the Komi Republic's flag. This flag had red and white stripes... lots of stars... It couldn't be, but Dezhnyov was sure of it. There was only one nation with a flag like that. Dezhnyov quickly grabbed the radio and began to speak.\n\n"This is Dezhnyov reporting an update regarding the situation at Kotlas Bridge. The vehicle's flying an American flag, over.""

 RUS_tourist.86.d: "Today we've arrived in Arkhangelsk, home to the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Remnants of the Soviet Union's Red Army, they used to control all of Western Russia, but shattered after the West Russian War. Despite the chilly temperature, Arkhangelsk seems like a pretty decent city. Lots of blackout curtains, military curfews, and underground shelters, but the soldiers are nice and the government seems stable. That's pretty good considering what I've seen and experienced elsewhere in Russia. The government assigned some soldiers to follow us around and ensure we didn't get into trouble, but that didn't stop our escorts from joining in on the fun every once in a while.\n\nMy entourage and I went out drinking with some Red Army soldiers. It was fun, and Zoya especially seemed to be enjoying herself during our stay in Arkhangelsk. The soldiers swapped some fun stories with us, although many of the jokes didn't survive translation. Occasionally the room would shake violently, but by the end of the night I couldn't tell if it was the alcohol or the anti-air defenses causing it.\n\nThe West Russian Revolutionary Front was a nice conclusion to my journey across Russia, although I still have one more stop to make. I write this entry as we drive towards the border with the Anti-Communist Guard in Onega. By tonight, I shall be in Helsinki."

 RUS_tourist.87.t: "Entry 32: The West Russian Revolutionary Front"
 RUS_tourist.87.d: "Today I arrived at the border with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Remnants of the Soviet Red Army, they are a highly-militarized faction that used to control all of Western Russia before the West Russian War. Unless I want to try and convince the Germans to let me through, this was the only way to get to Finland. Unfortunately, it appears my growing reputation in Russia is not as helpful as I had hoped.\n\nUpon reaching the border, several Red Army soldiers stopped our vehicle, and nationalized it in the name of Marshal Tukhachevsky. I was just getting attached to that thing too. At least their superiors were nice enough to give us some kind of compensation, giving us a few horses to carry our belongings for the rest of our journey, although we can't bring them into Onega. Clearly the Grand Marshal doesn't want us wandering off without supervision, and they've assigned a small convoy to escort us to Arkhangelsk where we will stay the night before immediately exiting the Front's territory. I would argue about the poor hospitality, but they've at least not attempted to shoot us yet.\n\nRegardless of how I feel about the loss of our truck, the Grand Marshal has guaranteed our safe transfer across the Onegan border, and the end of my journey is in sight. I won't let a disappointing finale ruin my adventure yet."
 RUS_tourist.87.a: "Then, onwards to America."

 RUS_tourist.88.t: "Crossing the Border"
 RUS_tourist.88.d: "Early in the morning, a convoy from the West Russian Revolutionary Front arrived at a heavily-staffed point along the Onegan border. A message from the Grand Marshal had ensured the meeting would take place, although the reason for the meeting was somewhat disappointing for the Anti-Communist Guard's command.\n\nThe highest-ranking officer present issued a command, and the American tourist, Steven Smith, and his entourage approached the Onegan troops unarmed. They were patted down and their belongings searched, and once satisfied they were permitted to cross the border. The American, his entourage, and their belongings were placed in a large armored vehicle, which exited the scene.\n\nAn uneasy silence held in the air for a few seconds after the American's new transport departed, broken as the majority of the Front's troops began to leave for Arkhangelsk. Within a few minutes, the border was the same as it always was, two sides entrenched in their positions, prepared for a sudden attack at any moment."
 RUS_tourist.88.a: "Some things never change."

 RUS_tourist.89.t: "Entry 33: Final Days in Onega"
 RUS_tourist.89.d: "It did not truly hit me until we crossed the border into the Volunteer Guard's territory and were allowed into Onega. I actually did it. We actually did it.\n\nWe crossed the entirety of Russia, through lands both impressive and terrifying, encountering people of both empathy and cruelty. I have seen sights I never knew existed, and learned more about myself than I ever thought possible.\n\nEven more astounding is the vast array of items we have collected. When I arrived, I had little more than my clothes, my journal, a small amount of money, and my flag. And now? Now we have coins and souvenirs from dozens of statelets. We have clothing from Oyrotia. We have ammunition from Zlatoust. We have a Tsarist tea set from Vyatka. And much more besides.\n\nTruly, this has been the journey of a lifetime, and even I am not sure how we managed to pull it off. Upon reflection, I can see so many times where things could have gone so badly. With the communists in Irkutsk and Tyumen. With our horrible trip through the Thief Territory to the border of Vorkuta. In our sojourn to the camps around Gorky, or the lands of that horrifying 'Brotherhood' in Perm. But we, together, surpassed all challenge, and I will never forget it.\n\nTomorrow we make for the Finnish border, where I will finally leave Russia and begin my long journey home. I know I should be elated, but I fear for when I shall have to leave them behind. Their friendship has grown to mean more to me than just about any item, and though I know I will always possess it, that will be cold comfort when I am a world away.\n\nEspecially Zoya, who has done so much to keep us, keep me, safe. I still do not know how I will react when we must separate.\n\nTonight, however, we will celebrate. I owe them that much."
 RUS_tourist.89.a: "One final night."

 RUS_tourist.90.t: "The Long Goodbye"
 RUS_tourist.90.d: "The group had crossed many, many borders during their long journey, but this one was different. This one was final. This one would be crossed alone.\n\nAs they approached the checkpoint, with its Finnish flag flying high and the soldiers manning it watching them for any signs of trouble, the man turned to those following him, tears flowing freely. Together they had marched across possibly the most dangerous and conflicted territory on the planet. They had ascended mountains at the edge of the world. And now they were parting.\n\nOne by one, he embraced each of them in turn, dispensing with most of the currency and valuables that had been accumulated over their journey. Thanking them, with both hug and handshake, he gave thanks for their loyalty, confidence, and assistance in all things, even when it should likely not have been so given.\n\nOnce he had done so, he stood in front of the woman. The woman who had followed him, guided him, and in some cases, saved him, from Siberia to the place where they now stood. The woman who would not be crossing the border. He found himself speechless, unable to think of words that could ever truly express what he felt.\n\nShe too, understood. A lifelong friendship, the kind of which could never have existed outside of shared adversity and which most people would never know, had been formed, and no matter where they were that would never change. Taking the initiative, she herself moved to draw the man into a tight embrace, concealing some small tears of her own. Thanks was not needed. It had always been given.\n\nAfter a long moment, the man stepped back, turning away from them all, and knowing he would never be able to take the steps needed otherwise. Then, ever so slowly, he picked up his remaining bags, and placed one foot in front of the other until he reached the checkpoint.\n\nHe continued through, and though he couldn't see it, his friends, the woman included, watched him until he passed over the horizon."

 RUS_tourist.91.t: "An Astounding Story"
 RUS_tourist.91.d: "Our government has today been informed of a most unusual occurrence.\n\nAccording to our forces in Karelia, a solitary American has entered the Republic from the territory of the Volunteer Guard in Onega, having claimed to have traversed nearly the entirety of Russia, from Petropavlovsk to Arkhangelsk. He further claims to have spent time in nearly all of the extant warlord statelets, compiling his observations and experiences in an extensive travel log.\n\nSkeptical of his claims, and ever-wary for potential communist infiltrators, the border officials were reportedly stunned when examining both his passport as well as various travel documents from nations all over Russia, which appear to corroborate his story. If true, this is no doubt a remarkable achievement.\n\nBut it is an achievement that does not involve us.\n\nWhat does involve us is the presence of an individual who, by action and admission, has crossed the territory of multiple communist states including, most recently, the West Russian Revolutionary Front. As such, the man presents a security risk, and must be removed. Presently.\n\nHe will be escorted to Helsinki and deported, via Scotland as per previous agreement, back to America. In this way a threat will be removed while diplomatic relations with America and the OFN are respected.\n\nTruly, the man has a fascinating and astounding story that we are sure he will tell. Just not in Finland."

 RUS_tourist.92.d: "Fyfe McCallion, a longtime employee of the Glasgow International Airport, never thought he would do anything unique in his lifetime, or meet anyone particularly special. He was proven wrong today; and not for a reason he expected.\n\nSometime before noon, a Finnish airlines flight landed in Glasgow International. While usually nothing out of the ordinary for planes from the east to be stopping here for refueling, Finnair Flight 192 was carrying a celebrity on board. Steve Smith, although just an average college student from the Midwest United States, was recently mad enough to travel the entirety of the Russian anarchy and live to tell the tale. A few days ago, he was detained by Finnish border patrol for trespassing into Finnish territory from Onega, and is now being deported back to the USA. Naturally, Steve's story has created a bit of a buzz around spheres aligned with the United States.\n\nFyfe was assigned to baggage handling today, and a distinctly unique suitcase rolled his way off the conveyor belt. The luggage itself was clearly vintage, probably something from the times of the Soviet Union, yet had a uniquely American flair to it. Despite all of the scratches and rust, stickers, souvenirs, and photographs adorned the luggage both inside and out. Fyfe would be holding a piece of history.\n\n"Excuse me, I think you have my luggage, sir." Fyfe met eyes with Steve, and in a panic, Fyfe extended his hand out for a handshake. Steve, with a smile, shook Fyfe's hand and nodded.\n\n"If ya don't mind, can I get a picture? For me kids. They're fascinated about adventure stories."\n\n"Oh, I can do more than that. When I get back to the States and publish my book, give them a call. I'll have them send your family one for free.\n\n"Rab!

 RUS_tourist.93.d: "Steve was startled awake as the plane's front wheel struck the ground, causing him to lurch forward into his seatbelt. Unsuccessfully wiping sleep from his bleary eyes, Steve peered out the window as the plane slowed to a crawl. He watched the airport workers going about their business soundlessly as the sun's cold glare broke out over the Minneapolis skyline.\n\nSteve was still half asleep as he unbuckled his seatbelt and staggered to his feet at the Captain's garbled command. Crouching down, he retrieved his bag and followed the other excited yet dreary red-eye passengers out of the plane. He wondered where the others had come from. Had they been visiting friends and family? On vacation to somewhere familiar yet far away? He grinned as he reminded himself he had been somewhere very few people of his background had been. Russia.\n\nFinally, after shuffling with the other travelers for what felt like hours, his boots struck American soil. Well, American carpet that covered the short jet bridge separating him from home, from his family. For all the bravery and guts that carried him through wartorn Russia, the homesickness he had pushed away as long as possible finally came pouring through the floodgates in the form of bittersweet tears as he neared the gate.\n\nEmerging into the airport, he immediately spotted his family waiting with grinning faces and minds abuzz with questions. Wordlessly, Steve embraced every family member who had come to meet him there. His mother teared up with joy that her son had made it home in one piece, which shouldn't have been a surprise considering he'd called her in Scotland. His father patted him on the back as they embraced, whispering heartfelt affirmations of his pride. Even a few cousins and his uncle were there, as well as a mass of people he didn't know. Surely, they'd been attracted to tales of his exploits, and Steve assured them wearily that their questions would be answered soon as he walked to his father's truck, stumbled into the backseat, and fell asleep before the car had even started."

 RUS_tourist.94.d: "After so many months of hard camping, often in the pitch-black wilderness and under the starry Russian sky, Steve Smith's family home felt almost alien.\n\nThe sky was different. The air was different. The people were different. And, more than anything else, the feeling was different. In Russia, as he had learned many times to his peril, danger was ever present, and the safety that he knew here, whenever it could be found, was inevitably fleeting.\n\nHe realized, with both a start and a sudden rush of guilt, that it wasn't fair. People had greeted him when he had returned. They had called him a brave explorer. The papers had done a couple small stories on him. In his hometown, he was now something of a celebrity.\n\nBut what about Zoya? About the others? The ones who had risked just as much as him, every step of the way, in their shattered and war-torn country? Where was their story, their celebrity? It was nowhere, Steve knew, and that he could not allow.\n\nDigging through his bags, he collected the voluminous journals he had filled out, the stacks of photographs he had taken, and the trinkets that he had kept that day at the Finnish border. He also collected his father's old typewriter. Arranging them all on his desk, he sat down and withdrew a stack of paper.\n\nHe could tell their story. He could recount the journey they had all taken together. He did not know how long it would take to write, edit, and publish, but he did know he would not rest until it was done.\n\nHe owed them that much."

 RUS_tourist.95.d: "The publication of a travelogue by American Steven Smith has drawn considerable interest both domestically as well as worldwide, with demand outpacing supply by a wide margin. Smith's book, 'Across the Tundra,' consists of a curated collection of journal writings, narrations, and photographs of the people, experiences, and locations encountered during his long journey across the entirety of Russia, from the Far East to Finland.\n\nProviding what more than one reviewer has called 'a fascinating window' into the tumultuous political situation of modern Russia, its publication has resulted in considerable public interest regarding humanitarian conditions and efforts within many of the less-fortunate Russian successor states, with officials in multiple countries calling for more attention to be dedicated to the provisions of such humanitarian aid."

She had not heard a word from him in months since his last letter. Even as the great land was being brought to heel by a half dozen or so such tyrants now left, their states establishing bonds with the land of the free, she still didn't get so much as a word of news on the state of her boy. Now, as she marked off another tally in the secret journal under her bed that she was sure Earnest didn't know about, she placed her head in her hands and began her tearless sobbing. She had simply run out by the first month after she began this nightly routine.\n\nGulping down the glass of water on her nightstand, she slid the journal back under the bed. Earnest was working late, or so she had been told, and so she had dedicated the hours between his call from work at 7:0 to his return home to her grief. Her suffering is cyclical as she awaits closure that simply never will come.\n\nEarnest was not working late. Clearing trash off the dashboard of his old beat up truck, he searched for the letter he had recovered last time he was 'working late', scouring the old main for any kind of news from Russia about his son. He had found only one scrap of closure after endless nights searching for something to placate his suffering wife, a communique from a Russian citizen from a city called Harbin writing to an American cousin of his about how he had seen an American pass through. That was it. Apart from the few letters he had gotten, this was all that was left of his son in paper. The famously stoic, hardworking man cast the letter aside as it was stained with tears, and laid his head on the steering wheel to cry."

 RUS_news.25.desc: "Sporadyczne doniesienia i komunikaty napływające ze Środkowej Syberii potwierdzają, że region ten znalazł się pod kontrolą nieznanej dotąd jednostki znanej jako Syberyjska Czarna Armia. Opierając się na naukach Nestora Machno z czasów rosyjskiej wojny domowej, stworzono społeczeństwo oparte na zmilitaryzowanym anarchizmie, gdzie ludność nie była chroniona przez państwo, ale przez lokalne milicje i ich dowódców, którzy mieli chronić gminy i ich anarchistyczny system.Ideologia ta, po raz pierwszy przyjęta na ziemiach między Centralną Republiką Syberyjską a Najwyższą Radą Gienricha Jagody w momencie upadku obu rządów, została obecnie wprowadzona na całym dawnym terytorium CSR przy użyciu siły zbrojnej przez nową Czarną Armię, pomimo wszystkich wyzwań, jakie niesie ze sobą taki system."

Jej pierwsi założyciele wzorowali się na Wolnym Terytorium Nestora Machno sprzed kilkudziesięciu lat i próbowali ją naśladować, tworząc anarchistyczne społeczeństwo, które utrzymywało siły zbrojne, choć zorganizowane przez miejscową ludność uczestniczącą w zarządzaniu gminami.\n\nMimo to, w miarę jak SCA rozszerzała swoją kontrolę na inne miasta i gminy w regionie, bojówki te, Czarna Armia, umacniały swoją kontrolę nad sprawami lokalnymi i krajowymi do tego stopnia, że ich anarchistyczny charakter był kwestionowany. Obecnie, stojąc jako siła jednocząca Środkową Syberię, czołowi członkowie SCA wydają się być bliżsi zmiażdżenia prawdziwego anarchistycznego marzenia, za którym kiedyś się opowiadali."

 RUS_news.86.desc: "When Russia first expanded across Asia, it was done by settlers and soldiers marching eastwards from Moscow until they reached the Pacific. Today Russia has been proclaimed whole once more, but this time the directions have been reversed.\n\nNikolay Petlin, the president of the Siberian National Republic, made a proclamation in the far eastern port city of Magadan that his nation had officially changed its name from the Siberian National Republic to the Russian National Republic in order to better reflect his government's undisputed claim of succession to the fallen Soviet government. Petlin was once a minister in the Russian Fascist Party splinter leader Mikhail Matkovsky's government, but overthrew his former leader and proved himself to be far more amenable to the OFN and other pro-democracy groups. Whether he shall maintain this attitude while in power, or even maintain power in the first place, is another question entirely.\n"

 RUS_news.87.desc: "Shocking news comes from Russia today as an official announcement has been made by the prime minister of the so-called Empire of Russia. Anatoly Sobchak, head of the civilian government of the newly-restored empire, has made a declaration confirming the reunification of all of Russia in the name of Tsar Mikhail II, who appeared alongside him during the declaration.\n\nScattered evidence and fragmentary reports have led experts to piece together that Sobchak and his administration have their roots in the exiled White Movement, originally based in Harbin. Mikhail II's legitimacy due to his parent's morganatic marriage notwithstanding, the tsar has already made a number of public appearances even before Sobchak's announcement promising a strong hand in dealing with Nazi Germany. Many celebrate the return of the Romanovs and the imperial system while others scoff at Mikhail's parentage. However, only time will tell how this new administration will fare.\n"

 RUS_news.88.desc: "Długi, ciemny cień Konstantina Rodzajewskiego i jego Rosyjskiej Partii Faszystowskiej Dalekiego Wschodu wydaje się rzucać dalej. Dziś, w wielkim przemówieniu na balkonie budynku parlamentu w Ust-Sysolsku, tak zwany „Wożd Rosji” ogłosił zjednoczenie Rosji. Z niepokojącymi doniesieniami o okrucieństwach popełnianych na Żydach w Rosji, wydaje się, że kontrola Rodzajewskiego nad narodem została już scementowana.\n\nDziwaczna teza wizji RPF dla Rosji stała się niesamowicie przerażającą rzeczywistością, gdy siły Rodzajewskiego posuwały się na zachód. Jego przemówienie zapowiadające zjednoczenie Rosji zawierało również zajadłą nienawiść do tych, których nazywał "perfidnymi Niemcami", twierdząc, że Niemcy nie zdołali stworzyć narodowo-socjalistycznego społeczeństwa i wzywając "wszystkich prawdziwych Rosjan" do służby w tym, co wydaje się być nadchodzącym konfliktem pomiędzy dwoma faszystowskimi rządami. Wydaje się, że tylko czas pokaże przyszłość tego nowego „narodowego państwa rosyjskiego”.\n"

 RUS_news.89.desc: "The churches of Russia sing hymns of praise as the Divine Mandate of Russia spreads its embrace across the shattered motherland, unifying the disparate peoples of Russia once more. Beginning as a peasant rebellion in the Far East, international commentators have found themselves baffled at the Mandate's rise to power, of which the only readily apparent cause can be found in one Alexander Men, the unofficial leader of the Mandate.\n\nOrganizing his state as almost anarchist, Men's ideology is a paradox. A devout Christian and preacher, and yet his state seems to be equally tolerant of all minority, religious, and ethnic groups. Incredibly isolationist, no diplomatic ties have yet been forged with this new Russia, leaving many to speculate just how it will effect the balance of the Cold War.\n"
