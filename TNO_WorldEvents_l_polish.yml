 WORLD.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Adolf Hitler nie żyje"
 WORLD.2.d: "Tragedia pochłonęła Niemcy, gdy wieści rozeszły się najpierw po Rzeszy, a potem po całym świecie. Zmarł Adolf Hitler, Führer Niemiec i zwycięzca II wojny światowej. Chociaż od pewnego czasu spekulowano o pogarszającym się stanie zdrowia Führera, wiadomość ta wprawiła Niemcy w kompletny szok. Reichstag ogłosił, że żałoba potrwa trzy miesiące, a Führer zostanie pochowany obok swojej zmarłej żony, Evy Hitler, a na pogrzeb zostaną zaproszeni dostojnicy z całego świata. \n\nPodczas gdy Niemcy pogrążone są w żałobie, na arenie międzynarodowej wiele osób świętuje śmierć człowieka odpowiedzialnego za trzy dekady cierpienia na całym świecie. Wielu międzynarodowych komentatorów obawia się jednak, co może teraz stać się z Niemcami, ponieważ Trzecia Rzesza jest już uwikłana w gorzką walkę o władzę z prawowitym następcą Führera."

 WORLD.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Niemiecka wojna domowa"
 WORLD.5.d: "Po śmierci Adolfa Hitlera w Rzeszy zapanował chaos. Pomimo wyznaczenia przez Führera legalnego następcy, potężne frakcje w Rzeszy wystąpiły przeciwko sobie, chcąc poprowadzić naród według swojej wizji. Naród jest rozdarty, a całe garnizony ignorują rozkazy z Germanii i płyną do wybranego przez siebie następcy. Choć powaga sytuacji nie jest jeszcze znana, szacuje się, że Rzesza stoi w obliczu całkowitego upadku władzy centralnej lub już go doświadcza.\n\nChoć niewiele wiadomo na temat losów wschodnich administracji Rzeszy, nagłe zerwanie kontaktów pomiędzy Germanią i jej posiadłościami wywołało spekulacje, czy i te regiony odnajdą swój los. Wiadomo jednak na pewno, że upadek europejskiego tytana rozerwał kontynent na strzępy."
 WORLD.5.a: "Na pewno koniec Rzeszy."

 WORLD.11.desc: "19 stycznia 1962 r. Eberhard Köllner został pierwszym człowiekiem, który wylądował na Księżycu. Podczas gdy wyścig kosmiczny toczył się między Rzeszą, Japonią i USA, i choć Amerykanom udało się umieścić pierwszego człowieka w kosmosie, Führer z dumą ogłosił, że niemieckie lądowanie zdecydowanie stawia Rzeszę w roli zwycięzcy w tej rywalizacji.\n\nW Germanii planowana jest wielka ceremonia wręczenia Köllnerowi i jego kolegom astronautom Żelaznego Krzyża, a w całej Rzeszy ogłoszono tydzień obchodów.\n\nPodczas gdy z Ameryki i Japonii napłynęły krótkie gratulacje, prezydent Nixon przyrzekł, że Stany Zjednoczone jako pierwsze stworzą stałą misję na Księżycu, a Japonia wkrótce potem ogłosiła, że jako pierwsza wyląduje na Marsie."

 WORLD.20.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Upadek Triumwiratu"
 WORLD.20.d: "Po bombardowaniu konferencji Triumwiratu na Malcie wydaje się, że wszelkie szanse, że kruchy sojusz spłonął w płomieniach. Incydent ten okazał się dla wielu ostatecznością, zarówno obaj Caudillo jak i prezydent Turcji zadeklarowali chęć opuszczenia sojuszu przez swoje kraje. Po odejściu dwóch z trzech głównych potęg sojuszu można śmiało powiedzieć, że czasy Triumwiratu dobiegły końca.\n\nJuż teraz Turcja ponownie wezwała do poszanowania swoich praw terytorialnych i ambicji w regionie, zwłaszcza w odniesieniu do Cypru i Lewantu, a włoskie wojsko zostało zmobilizowane w odpowiedzi na tureckie ruchy w Syrii. Ze swojej strony Iberowie wyrazili niewielką chęć utrzymywania znaczących stosunków ze swoimi dawnymi sojusznikami, zamiast tego spoglądając w kierunku własnych problemów."
 WORLD.20.a: "To była tylko kwestia czasu."

 WORLD.23.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Ekspansja w Afryce"
 WORLD.23.d: "Afryka Zachodnia ma ciężką sytuację od końca drugiej wojny światowej. Jednostki Luftwaffe bazujące na terenach należących do Rzeszy w Afryce Środkowej przez ostatnie dwie dekady bombardowały w pył wszystko, co znajdowało się w głębi lądu. \n\nPo śmierci Hitlera i upadku Rzeszy, te jednostki Luftwaffe nie ruszały się od dłuższego czasu. Już teraz kilka małych narodów na wybrzeżu zaczęło rozszerzać swoje granice w głąb lądu, nie obawiając się ciągłych niemieckich bombardowań. Czy bombardowania zostaną wznowione, czy nie, czas pokaże."
 WORLD.23.a: "Interesujące."

 WORLD.28.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Powstaje Pakt Anty-Heydrichowy"
 WORLD.28.desc: "Niemiecka wojna domowa przybrała wiele zwrotów akcji, ale to może być najdziwniejszy ze wszystkich. Wcześniej dzisiaj wielu pretendentów do tytułu Führera ogłosiło tymczasowe zawieszenie broni, aby skupić się na tym, co uznali za "największe zagrożenie dla Rzeszy" - Reinhardzie Heydrichu i jego SS.\n\nHeydrich i SS, wspierani jedynie przez Heinricha Himmlera, osiągnęli w ostatnich miesiącach zaskakujące postępy, pomimo ich słabej pozycji wyjściowej i braku siły politycznej i popularności. Wygląda na to, że wystraszyło to innych rywali, których siły zbierają się teraz, by położyć kres wojskom Heydricha. Ponieważ Heydrich jest dumnym wyznawcą zarówno Himmlera, jak i jego „systemu burgundzkiego”, musi być ulgą dla Niemców na całym świecie, że ich przywódcy mogą przynajmniej zgodzić się co do jednego - wzajemnej nienawiści do SS i tego, co ono reprezentuje."

 WORLD.34.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Zabójca atakuje Hitlera!"
 WORLD.34.desc: "Wiadomości z Niemiec są w najlepszym wypadku sporadyczne. Informacje przemycone z Germanii donoszą, że tuż po zakończeniu uroczystości związanych z lądowaniem na Księżycu, na ulicach pojawiły się oddziały wojskowe i kilka plutonów ochroniarzy, którzy natychmiast wprowadzili w mieście stan wojenny. Podobno zamachowiec, który według Niemców należał do japońskiego Kenpeitai, próbował zabić Führera, ale został powstrzymany przez jednego z osobistych ochroniarzy Hitlera.\n\nPojawiły się już doniesienia o różnych innych zamachach.  Na ulicach różne jednostki wojskowe omal nie pobiły się, gdy kilka jednostek nakazało sobie nawzajem ustąpić i łańcuch dowodzenia się rozpadł. Nagle Rzesza wydaje się dużo słabsza. Czy Niemcy mogą utrzymać swój Nowy Porządek Świata, skoro sami ledwo dają sobie radę?"

 WORLD.35.desc: "Przemoc wybuchła dziś w RPA, gdy Republika Burska, rozgniewana tym, co postrzegają jako niekończące się ataki na siebie ze strony rządu RPA, oficjalnie ogłosiła swoją niezależność od Republiki Południowej Afryki.\n\nTowarzyszące z oświadczeniem milicje burskie, uzbrojone głównie w broń niemiecką, rozprzestrzeniły się po Wolnym Państwie Pomarańczowym i wielu innych częściach północno-zachodniej Afryki Południowej, wchodząc w konflikt zbrojny z żołnierzami południowoafrykańskimi stacjonującymi na tym obszarze.\n\nW miarę narastania konfliktu nie wiadomo jeszcze, jaka będzie odpowiedź Niemiec. Jednak, gdy obserwatorzy donoszą o postępującej militaryzacji granicy południowoafrykańskiej przez nowo utworzoną Afrika-Schild, wielu uważa, że odpowiedź Niemiec jest oczywista."

 WORLD.36.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Afrika-Schild Intervenes In South Africa"
 WORLD.36.desc: "As the Boer rebellion rages on, international journalists on the ground are reporting that German colonial panzer divisions have now begun to pour across the South African border in a rapid escalation of the conflict. Forces of the newly formed 'Afrika-Schild' have already won several key victories, forcing already stretched thin South African soldiers into retreating south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for almost a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by quickly spreading footage of a battle-bloody South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, who asked the cameras the question that many have been asking:\n\n"Where the fuck are the Yankees?""

 WORLD.37.desc: "W miarę jak sytuacja w Europie szybko się rozwija, a sfera niemiecka popada w całkowity upadek, wielu zastanawiało się, jaki ewentualny ruch wykona tajmnicze "czarne państwo". Wraz z niedawno wyciekłymi z Niemiec materiałami filmowymi ukazującymi konwoje SS przemieszczające się do Burgundii, granicy, która z dnia na dzień stała się jedną z najbardziej zmilitaryzowanych na Ziemi, wielu obserwatorów uznało to za dowód na to, że Heinrich Himmler wycofał swoje poparcie dla Reinharda Heydricha ubiegającego się o tytuł Führera.\n\nJednak teraz ujawniło się prawdziwe rozumowanie. Podczas gdy społeczność międzynarodowa wciąż stara się zrozumieć ten chaos, burgundzkie czołgi wjeżdżają do Paryża, a francuskie wojsko, poważnie osłabione niemieckimi sankcjami, zostało zmuszone do całkowitego odwrotu lub zniszczono całe dywizje, gdziekolwiek odważyły się stanąć."

Dowodzona przez nowo awansowanego generała Paula D. Harkinsa, MAAG jest rzekomo jedynie doradcą w zakresie szkolenia i przygotowania południowoafrykańskich żołnierzy, którzy mają im pomóc w walce z wkraczającymi RK, przy czym rząd USA twierdzi, że nie walczą oni w wojnie, a jedynie "wspomagają inny wolny naród w jego najczarniejszej godzinie".\n\nWzbudziło to wiele brwi, zwłaszcza że amerykańskie bombowce z USS Saratoga i Essex zaczęły już okładać niemieckie pozycje, a amerykańskich żołnierzy sfotografowano wraz ze swoimi południowoafrykańskimi odpowiednikami w ciężkich walkach. Czy jako część „Grupy Doradczej”, czy jako część armii, Stany Zjednoczone przyłączyły się teraz do wojny południowoafrykańskiej. Czas pokaże, czy reszta OWN nadejdzie..."

 WORLD.39.desc: "In perhaps unsurprising news, the OFN has agreed to join America in the ongoing struggle in South Africa. With enough votes to push the organization into the war, the allied nations of the United States have already began landing in South African ports, flying over Boer skies and fighting across the rugged battlefields of Africa. This news has been celebrated by the United States who has proclaimed that the OFN has proven that it is dedicated to the safety and protection of all free people of the world, with politicians and generals both decrying those who have accused the OFN of being a do-nothing organization. It remains to be seen how useful this will be to South Africa, though the South African military is reportedly pleased."

 WORLD.40.desc: "In shocking news, the U.S. war conference with the rest of the OFN has fallen apart into infighting. After numerous votes against, the diplomats from the United States called off the vote and reportedly stormed from the meeting chambers. While U.S. allies in the OFN are berating their fellow members of the organization for "sabotaging the integrity of the great institution", they can do little to truly force these nations to participate and what's being increasingly called an 'American war'. The United States has stated it will not let petty politics stop its now surely damaged mission to South Africa, and that it and its true allies would be joining the war regardless of what anyone may think. One thing is for certain however, the reputation of the OFN is surely tarnished."

American reporters were, as always, the first to break the news while the international community has struggled to play catchup with the shocking news of violence spreading across England. It seems that while chaos reigns on the mainland, the British resistance has decided to make their move.\n\nPerhaps most shocking is their leader. Claude Auchinleck, former British general in charge of defending the isles during the German invasion, now leads a coalition of resistance groups across the nation in rebellion against the Germans. Auchinleck had been a quiet, diminutive card carrying member of the nation's Royal Party, but now leads his men in full military uniform in battle against the German garrison and the local collaborators. He proclaims, alongside his allies from a dozen different ideologies of twice that many resistance groups, that England shall be free again... or that they shall all die as free men."

Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and the many resistance cells it contained have been destroyed by the English government, those few survivors finding themselves captured or routed to Wales and Scotland where they will no doubt harass the English for years to come. The coalition of resistance forces is dead, and Auchinleck himself has disappeared. What exactly has become of the leader is unknown.\n\nThe rebellion, the final one for the English many believe, is over, a last cry of freedom harshly beaten down, a final flickering flame hushed out in the dead of night.\n\nWith the resistance destroyed, the English government now moves to rebuild the nation and look to the future. Many, however, question if England might be irrevocably changed. Will the Germans still trust the English to handle their own affairs?

Pubs across England proudly declare that all drinks are free to the brave members of HMMLR and the united British resistance of Wales, Cornwall and England. This of course means that drinks are free to all, the already blurry line of who constitutes a member of these shadowy cells becoming blurrier under the powers of strong drink, proud song and boisterous celebration.\n\nFrom the steps of the now liberated Westminster with his rapidly assembled cabinet, Auchinleck has declared himself defense secretary and declared a brief period of martial law until the new government can be formed and England restored to order.

Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the emergency council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."

Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the "immoral, colonial alliance", many within the German sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent."

Already, partisan brigades from resistance cells, including Bill Alexander's Communist Front which had allied with HMMLR previously in the year, have taken much from the collaborators.

The victors of this strife are amongst the most hearted and ideologically fanatical to come out of the conflict. Now, they are untethered by any former leash placed upon them during the reign of Franco and are ready to unleash the dogmatic dreams of their long dead founder, José Antonio Primo de Rivera.\n\nAddressing a mass of Blue Shirts, Falangist Jefe Jaime Milans del Bosch spoke of his plans to shape Spain in a truly Falangist image. What this means to those who are left out of the Falangist 'utopia' is unlikely to be anything good, as reports of extrajudicial executions have started to emerge. Whilst war may be over, Spain is unlikely to rest easy under El Jefe's reign."

Despite the strong resistance, all Spaniards woke up this morning to an entirely new reality. The union is no more. Its ideals were swept away by corruption, civil war and democratic fervor."

The royal government, headed by the Regent Farah Pahlavi, has fortified the north in a desperate bid to halt the onslaught of Islamists, radicalized students, socialists and foreign-backed powers seeking to take over the country. This Iranian Revolutionary Alliance, an unstable republican faction united by the goal of ending monarchism, is expected to siege Tehran within the month.

With strong African resistance to Correntia still present, it's hard to say how long this brutal regime will last, but Correntia's victory, even if ephemeral, means a complete defeat of any of Italy's projects to restore peace to the region.\n"

Weeks of buildup included the prime minister's accusation of the United States' involvement in the destruction of the ship to the secretary of the navy sending an aircraft carrier down to launch a reconnaissance mission around the area the Tosa sunk, and, finally, it appears as though a surface-to-air missile was responsible for the destruction of the aircraft and the death of her pilot. With this, the United States has entered its first major war in nearly twenty years.\n\nFrom this point on, it is estimated that the full land, air, and sea forces of both the Empire of Japan and the United States of America will be dedicated to waging war within Pacific territories, as the world watches on in fear and terror. With the question of nuclear buildup from both forces dawning in the minds of all, some wonder just how long the world may have before all is lost?"

For months, Americans cried, calling for action to be taken in the wake of finding a dedicated and innocent patriot of the United States having been killed by the Nazis; however, amid growing military tensions in the Middle East, the president officially called for the backing down of the United States in the issue.\n\nAlthough several firebrands call for toughening relations with the Empire of Japan in the United States, many Americans still believe in the threat of the Reich and call upon the images of the defense of England in their reason for entrenchment against the Reich.

It was assumed that the Reich and republic would bicker over it as they always did, one would be the petty winner and the other the petty loser, and life would go on.\n\nHowever, one after another, the superpowers proved unwilling to sacrifice their dignity for survival, and so the conflict escalated more and more, until the Middle East was aflame and hundreds of soldiers lay dead. Now there is no turning back. Both nations have moved to formally declare war and are mobilizing their reserves and missile defence systems for a full-scale conflict. It should only be assumed that when the nukes fly neither the uninvolved Empire of Japan or the myriad of smaller powers will be spared, or that they will not retaliate with their own weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTo some, this was inevitable. Ever since the last war, it had seemed that humanity was constantly teetering at the brink of destruction, only to be saved by some chance event or another. To others, the end of the world will no doubt be a surprise - caught by the nuclear fire asleep or in their bathtubs.\n\nIt does not matter now.

This was despite the rather explosive and public feud between Prime Minister designate Robert Stanfield and his forcibly resigned predecessor, John Diefenbaker. The latter had been elbowed out of the party by a coalition of disgruntled party members of all stripes, with the popular Premier of Nova Scotia chosen to replace him. Despite this unceremonious departure, and the strong campaigns from the Liberals, the CCF and the Social Credit Party, the Progressive Conservatives have rallied around Stanfield, and are ready to govern the nation.\n\nWith Canada's Centennial a few months away, it appears that the country is ready for the party whose history traces back to the first Prime Minister to lead them into the second century of Canada."

From his involvement in the 1932 Revolution against royal absolutism, to leading Thailand to victory in war against the European imperialists, to the declaration of a Thai republic - Phibunsongkhram's legacy is perhaps the greatest in Thai history.\n\nHis passing was announced to the nation by an interim governing council, consisting of various prominent bureaucrats and generals, now entrusted to manage the immediate fallout of the passing of Thailand's pater patriae. However, with power now resting in Bangkok's most cunning schemers, many now wonder how long until the balance of power tips, and violence swallows the young republic."

His principled character, reputation, and charismatic leadership had won over the people and, despite rivalries within the service, support of many in the army.\n\nHowever, the situation remains delicate; Admiral Thawan's coalition of support is but a house of cards, only tacitly supported by military leadership. It is currently unknown how the new military administration will handle the current chaos in the young republic, and only time will tell if continued support for Admiral Thawan's government will last."

It appears that this was the final straw, and two large blocs of politicians have now officially announced their departure from what they call 'the degenerated, false Congress'.\nThe internal Congress right-wing, led by C. Rajagopalachari, and the Gandhian wing, led by J.B.

 novel.1.d: ""Heirs of Babylon" is a newly released fiction book detailing an 'alternative' universe in which the Third Reich lost its struggle against the decadent capitalist West and the mongrel states of Russia after our beloved Führer was cut down by a sniper's bullet in 1935. Written by Cornish author Antony Beevor, "Heirs of Babylon" details the lives of people living in divided Berlin, Londium, Alexandria, and Philadelphia - the new capital of the Americas. Much of the world is divided between the Imperial Dominion of Britannia, who have reclaimed their traditional thrones in Germany and France; the United American Federation whose borders stretch from the North Pole to the South Pole; and the insidious pan-Eurasian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nFerdinand Featherston is an investigator, a Britannian detective with a licence to kill and beholden only to Her Britannic Majesty. Searching for his wife in red Europe, he is swept up by a world-shaking plot in Berlin. The chase takes him to America, France, Africa and finally to Gibraltar in a series of daring escapes and high-speed gun battles.\n\nThe crux of the novel's events is the Gibraltar Missile Crisis, a tense nuclear standoff between the dominion and the pan-Eurasian union, while the United Federation seeks to undermine both sides and provoke a war for their own purposes.\nThe novel ends in uncertainty, with tanks massing across the Gibraltar border and an American fleet refusing to answer hails circling like vultures.

 novel.2.a: "... I never thought I could laugh like this again. Oh Lord..."

 novel.3.t: "Człowiek w Żelaznej Twierdzy"
 novel.3.d: "Science fiction author Phillip K. Dick has released his latest novel, named "The Man in the Iron Fortress." A work of speculative alternate history, the novel takes place in a dystopian world where communism reigns supreme. The 'point of divergence' in the story's history is that the socialist politician Eugene Debs remained with the Democrats, becoming president in 1920. As a result, he supported the nascent Soviet Union and the May Fourth movement in China. Debs' beliefs died with him in 1926, and his successor Robert La Follette proved to be far more isolationist, a trend that dominated American politics for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became dominated by the authoritarian Felix Dzerzhinsky, while the communists under Mao Tse-tung were able to unite China and counter-invade the Japanese. When the Nazis rose to power, they were able to crush the unsupported Allied nations of Europe, but were unprepared for a surprise Soviet invasion and were swiftly defeated. In 1947, a joint Sino-Soviet army invaded America, leading to them dividing the country north-south.\n\nThe novel is set within occupied America and follows a wide cast of characters, from a Cheka spy to a Chinese official obsessed with American cowboy culture. At the center of its plot is a book called "The Beast Among the Reeds," which tells of a world where both Nazism and communism were defeated. The political backdrop is one of rapidly decaying Sino-Soviet relations; Dzerzhinsky is succeeded after his death by the even more totalitarian Lavrentiy Beria, and the threat of nuclear war looms on the horizon.\n\nDespite the novel's criticism for seemingly unrealistic developments (the Soviets allegedly drained the Baltic Sea for farmland and built a giant bridge stretching across the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska), Dick has defended the action as being plausible within the best available information he could acquire at the time. That still hasn't stopped the book from becoming a bestseller in the United States and Canada, and it has already been nominated for a Hugo Award."

XX wieku.\n\nThompson spędza dziesiątki stron na szczegółach każdego „punktu rozbieżności”, niekolorowych winiet w nadrzędnej historii, które szczegółowo opisują, w jaki sposób świat tej powieści różnił się od naszego. Te bezczelne i często bezsensowne historie opisują niedorzeczne epizody, takie jak przykład japońskiego lekarza z Oddziału 731, który przypadkowo spróbował narkotyku halucynogennego z własnej mikstury, co doprowadziło go do spadnięcia armii zaćpanych „ghuli” w centrum Tokio. Choć krytycy są podzieleni, zwykli czytelnicy, zmęczeni przesyceniem rynku literackiego tanimi, zbyt poważnymi powieściami „historii alternatywnej” uznali je za mile widzianą, choć dziwną odmianę od normy.\n\nŁącząc te różne epizody razem, Thompson rozwinął niejasne pozory fabuły w tym alternatywnym Los Angeles, składającej się głównie z tanich alegorii atakujących współczesną amerykańską kulturę polityczną. W jednej z pamiętnych scen uliczny gang wzorowany na Yockeyitach pobił demonstrację "starych yuppie bigotów" (zwolenników Nixona, nazywanych też "krwiożerczymi dziwakami"), podczas gdy nietrzeźwy Thompson ogląda z młodzieńczą radością.\n\nChoć opinie krytyków i czytelników na temat tej powieści są podzielone, większość przynajmniej przyznaje, że jest to zjadliwa i skuteczna krytyka obecnego klimatu literackiego i politycznego."

W 1962 r. świat jest zdewastowany przez opad nuklearny i podzielony przez czterostronne zawieszenie broni, grożące albo zakończeniem cywilizacji, albo zniewoleniem jej przez różne odmiany totalitaryzmu.\n\nończąca się "angielsko-socjalistyczną" Amerykańską Wspólnotą Narodów, która rozpada się na kawałki, stając się trzecią amerykańską wojną domową, gdy buntują się biali supremacjoniści na Południu, powieść była analizowana pod kątem jej złożonych paraleli z gwałtownymi konfliktami toczącymi się na całym świecie,  choć niektórzy odrzucają ją jako nie różni się od reszty nadmiaru powieści alternatywnej historii, które w ostatnich latach wypełniały półki z książkami. Odpowiadając na krytyków, Orwell odniósł się do nieprawdopodobieństwa tego wszechświata, pisząc „(...) ten wszechświat jest nie mniej dziwny niż wszystko, co wydarzyło się w naszym przez ostatnie pół wieku.”"

 novel.10.t: "Another Planet's Hell"
 novel.10.d: "The novel "Another Planet's Hell" has released today, giving its author, Aldous Huxley, quite the reputation for its themes and story. The book is set in an alternative reality, where Adolf Hitler dies during his attempted putsch in 1923 and never takes power, instead superseded by the monarchist DNVP and its leader, Alfred Hugenberg. In Russia, Nikolai Bukharin loses to Joseph Stalin, who centralizes power and creates an almost nightmarish dictatorship that strengthens the union. The Second World War is is started by the newly formed Deutsche Ordensstaat, a military junta backed by the Kaiser, and is led by Hugenberg, Erwin Rommel and Erich Ludendorff (in the book, the junta is called the Crusader's Council).\n\nThe book takes place during the war, in occupied France. Its protagonist, Anne-Marie Manouchian, starts as a college professor teaching chemistry, but becomes a bombmaker after the school is shut down and many of its professors arrested for promoting anti-German ideals. During her struggle, she meets the two other primary protagonists; Jack, an OSS agent helping the resistance, and Nikolai, a Soviet agent running guns to communist militias. As the story goes on, the three primary factions emerge; first, the Imperial Entente, a faction led by a more reactionary United Kingdom and a Bonapartist France. Second, the Alliance of Soviets, a Russia-led faction poised at spreading world communism. Finally, there exists the Pacific Joint-Defense Group, an alliance led by a more democratic Japan and the United States.\n\nThe book ends with Anne-Marie witnessing the nuclear bombing of the city of Dresden, while Nikolai says that "this is not an end, but a beginning to a world torn open by flame. Your children shall be communists, or you shall not have children." The book has been criticized by many as being overly pessimistic and heavy on details, but others have insisted that this could have been a reality had things played out differently. Huxley has defended the novel, saying that "as miserable as things are, we can at least be thankful for what could never happen.""

 novel.11.t: "The Blue Order"
 novel.11.d: "An intriguing work of fiction has been gaining traction around the world in the past few weeks. Said novel, titled "The Blue Order," authored under the pen name of "Miles Lloyd" depicts a world in which a radical, authoritarian politician runs for the American Presidency in 1932, associated with the revived "Bull Moose Party." This president, only known to readers as "the president," quickly proceeds to consolidate his power under the guise of defending America, and rapidly turns the American economy into one fueled by preparation for an 'eventual war'. With this in mind, he issues an ultimatum to Nazi Germany upon the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936. Any further military movements will be met with swift American reprisal. Upon the Anschluss of Austria, the president declares war on Germany, under the guise of "safeguarding liberty".\n\nHistory is then lost in this world for two decades. Upon sunrise of some arbitrary day, the world is revealed to have been torn apart by a Second World War. In Russia, the Soviets have lost all of Eastern Siberia to the American Republic, while the death of Bukharin throws the remainder into chaos. In Asia, the State of Japan lies under American supervision, having lost against them prior. In Europe, the British Isles, Iberia, and Italy remain as the last major independent regions, having formed a strange alliance of democracy and fascism, with the Soviets being a previous member before Bukharin's death. In the remains of mainland Europe, American puppet 'republics' sit under lock and chain. American control is not absolute, however, with various warlord states waiting for the sunset to liberate their homelands.\n\nThe president cannot live forever, however, and upon his assassination at the end of the novel, the sun begins crossing the horizon, as the destiny of humanity hangs in the balance."

 novel.12.t: "The Occupation"
 novel.12.d: "A new book has been flying off the shelves across the world, circulating heavily even in the black markets of Germany. Entitled "The Occupation", the book describes an alternate history where the Germans are defeated in the Second World War. In it, Japan collapses into civil war with communists and lose their footholds on mainland Asia. Though the emperor eventually prevails, Japan never recovers and opts to lick its wounds rather than embark on the conquests it did in our world. Thus, once the Germans are pushing across England and the United States finally intervenes, they are not distracted by the fighting in the Pacific and manage to defeat and occupy Germany. The defeated Reich is split into two halves: the German People's Republic, a Soviet puppet state consisting of the north, and the Republic of Germany, an allied occupation zone with self-government consisting of the south, the Rhineland, and Austria. The two are more commonly known as North and South Germany in the story. Once again, a nationalist and revanchist government is elected in South Germany, similar to Hitler's rise in our own world. Having learned from the mistakes of the past, South Germany is quickly invaded and the old government reinstated by the Allies. The story follows a poor German youth who is believed to be a nationalist by the occupying Western powers. Although he isn't at the start of the book, his unjustified persecution by the occupiers eventually leads him to become one, and the book hints that this is part of an endless cycle that will always lead to oppression and violence by one side. It also hints that something similar and far more dangerous may occur with the now-recovered Japan.\n\nThe book has proven stunningly controversial. Many claim it is Nazi schlock, trying to clear them of wrongdoing and insinuating that their reaction to Versailles was justified. Others claim that it is simply unrealistic, and that Japan's communist movement would have never been strong enough to do the damage the book has them do. The author says they are all missing the point, and that the book is more about the message rather than the setting."

 novel.13.t: "SSR-Ostpreussen"
 novel.13.d: "This week, author Len Deighton published his newest novel, "SSR-Ostpreussen". The novel takes place in an alternate history where Mikhail Tukhachevsky launches a coup against Bukharin in the late 1920s, transforming the Soviet Union into a military state comparable to Napoleon's France. 'The New Bonaparte' as he is styled, launches numerous invasions of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia at a time when the rest of the world is still reeling from the Great Depression and unable to respond, significantly strengthening the Soviets' position. Hitler's Germany finds a much tougher opponent in this union and the war between the two lasts for many years, until both sides are forced into peace after each discovers the atomic bomb simultaneously and the cities of Königsberg and Kiev are annihilated.\n\nThe story focuses on a commissar of the Red Army who has been assigned to oversee the reconstruction of Soviet-held Königsberg, now rechristened Stalingrad after a close ally of Tukhachevsky. Upon discovering the murder of a prominent government official, the commissar finds himself embroiled in a byzantine web of plots involving the Soviet high command, the local garrison, and partisans from the heavily oppressed and radiation-scarred German inhabitants of the city. Hints are laid throughout the story of greater goings on behind the scenes, such as massive instability in German-controlled Western Europe and extensive Soviet military campaigns in Northern Iran and Western China. The story ends with the commissar narrowly escaping death at the hands of his superiors and uncovering a plot to provoke the Reich into a new war.\n\nThe book has drawn praised for its unique take on the noir genre and its gritty setting amidst the burned-out streets of Stalingrad. Some have criticised it for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the German characters, with a few even going as far as to suggest that Deighton may possess Nazi ideals. Regardless, it has already had a quite successful first run of sales and is expected to become a staple of alternate history for years to come."
